# LEXGRO Style Guide

Your guide to writing style and terminology for all copy on the website, blog posts, social media, and marketing materials.

The legal marketing space is oversaturated with content. It's important for our content to engage in a simple, straightforward way that connects with people. We aim to educate, empower, and encourage our readers.

---

## Our Voice

The LEXGRO voice is how we talk to our readers. It's the blend of personality, substance, tone, and style.

While our voice remains consistent regardless of who we're talking to or what we're saying, we adapt our tone to fit the context and the reader's mindset.

Our voice is:

- **Friendly and informative:** We're organic. Though our content is technical in nature we want to present it in a human, relaxed way.
- **Authoritative yet personable:** We're credible. That doesn't mean that we condescend or belittle our reader.
- **Conversational and clear:** We speak in a way that our target audience can understand. We try to avoid jargon and clunky sentences.

---

## Guidelines for Content

- Keep paragraphs under 5 lines. White space on the page keeps the eye moving.
- Introduce new terms in their own sentence.
  - **Incorrect:** "A definitive marketing strategy generally requires a CMO, which is a Chief Marketing Officer."
  - **Correct:** "A CMO is a Chief Marketing Officer. This role is generally required for a definitive marketing strategy."
- Using second-person ("you") is acceptable and encouraged.

## Readability

Try to keep your Flesch reading score between 50 and 60. Any score below 50 is difficult to read by someone who may not have a high school reading level. You can find Flesch score analysis online. It is also part of Grammarly.

You can read more about the Flesch reading score here: https://yoast.com/flesch-reading-ease-score/

---

## Grammarly

Use Grammarly for every piece before you publish it. Don't accept every suggestion that it provides. Look at the suggestions and see if they make sense. This is primarily to be used as an additional layer of spell checking and grammar checking. The free version is fine for this. It will also provide you with a Flesch reading score.

---

## Meta Descriptions and Titles

Every piece of content you write will have to include a meta description. You can read about meta descriptions here: https://yoast.com/meta-descriptions/

A meta title is the title that shows up in Google. It may be the same as the page title, or different.

Both the title and description have to be a certain length. On every page you write, check your meta description and title using: https://seomofo.com/snippet-optimizer.html

It will tell you if they are too long.

### Length Requirements
- **Meta title:** 50-60 characters
- **Meta description:** 150-160 characters maximum

---

## Headers

You won't need to go deeper than H3. Format headers properly:

- Use H1 for the actual Title of the article (only one per page)
- Use H2 for major sections
- Use H3 for subsections

---

## Linking

**Every time you mention a study, statistic, or specific piece of research, you must provide a link.**

Anchor text refers to the text that links to another page. For example, the word "google" is the anchor text for this link: [google](http://google.com/).

Try to get anchor text that uses keywords if possible. Also if possible, do not use just one word as the anchor text:

**Good:** "More data based on [studies done on law firm marketing ROI](http://example.com/) is available from the Legal Marketing Association"

**Bad:** "More data based on studies done on law firm marketing ROI is available from the [Legal Marketing Association](http://example.com/)"

At the bottom of the page, provide a list of every source used.

Title the list "References" with an H2. Use APA 7th edition format:

```
## References

Author, A. A. (Year, Month Day). *Title of article in sentence case*. Site Name. https://url

Organization Name. (Year, Month Day). *Title of article in sentence case*. Site Name. https://url
```

**APA format rules:**
- No numbers or bullets
- Author or organization name first, then year in parentheses
- Article title in sentence case, italicized with asterisks
- Site name in plain text (omit if same as author/organization)
- Bare URL at end (no hyperlink brackets, no period after URL)
- One blank line between each reference
- If no date is available, use `(n.d.)`
- No descriptions after the URL

---

## Where to Find Sources

For law firm marketing content, prioritize these sources:

1. **Primary sources:** Bar associations, ABA, state bar journals
2. **Industry reports:** Clio Legal Trends Report, Thomson Reuters State of the Legal Market
3. **Marketing data:** HubSpot, Google research studies
4. **Economic data:** Bureau of Labor Statistics, Census Bureau

If you find a study in another source, link back to the original study, not the secondary source.

---

## Lists

When writing out bulleted lists of items followed by a colon, bold the item in question.

Example:

- **Fractional CMO:** A part-time Chief Marketing Officer who provides strategic leadership without full-time costs.
- **Cost per case:** The total marketing spend divided by the number of signed cases.
- **Intake optimization:** The process of improving how leads are converted to signed clients.

---

## Verbiage

### Terms and Definitions
- When saying "also known as" or similar (when defining new terms), italicize the thing it's known as instead of using quotation marks
  - Example: This marketing approach, also called *inbound marketing*, focuses on attracting clients through valuable content.

### Starting Sentences
- Do not begin a sentence with a number, even when that number is a common "word". Either replace it with the spelled-out version (Twenty versus 20) or add a word.
  - **Incorrect:** 62 percent of law firms lack a marketing strategy.
  - **Correct:** There are over 62 percent of law firms that lack a marketing strategy.
  - **Also correct:** According to research, 62 percent of law firms lack a marketing strategy.

### Fluff Words to Avoid

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| in order to | to |
| really | (be specific: "$2.3 million" not "really expensive") |
| a lot | (quantify: "3,000 firms" not "a lot of firms") |
| very | (be specific or remove) |
| stuff | (name the actual things) |
| things | (be specific) |
| believe, think | (provide factual statements with sources) |
| always, never | rarely, often, typically, seldom |
| in addition to this | in addition |
| whether or not | whether |
| utilize | use |
| leverage (as verb) | use, apply, build on |
| synergy | combine, integrate |

### Voice and Structure
- Shoot for active voice whenever possible (maximum 20 percent passive voice):
  - **Active:** Angela ate the bacon.
  - **Passive:** The bacon was eaten by Angela.
  - Reference: https://www.grammarly.com/blog/active-vs-passive-voice/

- You want plenty of white space to keep the readers' eye moving down the page. That means no more than 4-5 lines per paragraph.

- Mix up sentence length to keep the reader engaged.

- Avoid beginning two paragraphs in a row with the same word.

- Avoid using the same word twice in a sentence. If it's unavoidable, separate the instances as much as possible.

- Do not start or end a section on a bulleted or numbered list. There should always be one full line of text (minimum) before and after a list.

---

## Numbers

- Always use comma for thousands (1,000 not 1000)
- Spell out numbers zero through nine, use numerals for 10 and over
  - **Exceptions:** Always write the numeral for measurements:
    - Time (1 year, 1 month, etc.)
    - Length, width, height, etc.
    - Millions and above: 1 million, 1 billion
- In decimals, always have at least one number to the left of the decimal point, even if it's a zero:
  - **Incorrect:** .456
  - **Correct:** 0.456
- Years:
  - **Incorrect:** 1970's, the 70's, the 70s, the '70's
  - **Correct:** 1970s, the '70s

### Money
- Use numerals with $ symbol: $50,000
- For ranges: $50,000 to $100,000 (not $50,000-$100,000)
- Round numbers when exact precision isn't needed: "around $50,000" not "$49,873"

### Percentages
- Use % symbol with numerals: 25% (not "25 percent")
- More scannable for data-driven content
- In headlines, can spell out fully for impact: "Cut Costs by Forty Percent"

---

## Special Characters

### Do Not Use
- & (use "and")
- # (except in hashtags)
- w/ (write out "with")

### Okay to Use
- $ (when immediately preceding a number; not in place of the word "dollar")
- % for percentages (25%)
- " for inches
- ' for feet

### Spell Out
- degree (It was 65 degrees outside)
- and (not &)
- degree (It was 65 degrees outside; The unit has 40-degree gradeability)

### Do Not Use Symbols For
- Copyright
- Trademark
- Registered trademark

---

## General Rules

- *That* refers to things; *who* refers to people
- Use "whom" when you could use "him" in the same sentence
- Try to use some form of the keyword in every subtitle, i.e. not just "Pros and Cons" but "Pros and Cons of Fractional CMO Services"
- Choose subtitles you think people are likely to Google whenever possible
- Check all titles, even those supplied by the client, for grammar, spelling, etc. When in doubt, ask.
- Use the Oxford comma:
  - **Incorrect:** Strategy, execution and results
  - **Correct:** Strategy, execution, and results
- Job titles are not capitalized unless they precede a name:
  - The managing partner signed the contract.
  - Managing Partner Keith Dunnivant signed the contract.
- Use person-first language as much as possible:
  - *Law firms that struggle with marketing* instead of *struggling law firms*
- Use US instead of U.S. when referring to the United States. You can also simply write out "United States"

---

## Words with More Than One Correct Spelling

LEXGRO uses:

- **healthcare** instead of health care
- **ecommerce** instead of e-commerce
- **email** instead of e-mail
- **website** instead of web site
- **online** instead of on-line
- **co-pay** (hyphenated)
- **co-insurance** (hyphenated)
- **anti-inflammatory** instead of antiinflammatory

> Generally speaking, we opt for the hyphenated versions of longer words because they're easier to read.

---

## Header Capitalization

- Title caps for all headlines. You can use https://capitalizemytitle.com/ to check your capitalization. Make sure you select APA.

---

## Bulleted Lists

- **Proper format:** Content here
  - If using colon: Only capitalize the first word before the colon and first word after the colon (unless the words would be capitalized within a sentence); bold the words before the colon but not the colon itself
  - Do not follow with the same words used in the bullet
    - **INCORRECT** - **Fractional CMO:** Fractional CMO services provide...
    - **CORRECT** - **Fractional CMO:** Part-time executive marketing leadership provides...

- Numbered lists are only used when it makes sense to itemize the list: sequential order, top X, and timeline are the only real times we'd use numbered lists.

---

## Hyphenated Words

Generally, follow Grammarly guidelines about hyphenation. There is a lot of hyphenation that is often missed for things like "data-driven" or "full-service".

Common hyphenated terms in legal marketing:
- cost-per-case
- full-service
- data-driven
- results-oriented
- client-focused
- high-value
- long-term
- short-term

---

## Absolute Rules (Never Break These)

1. **No em-dashes (—):** Use periods, commas, colons, or parentheses instead. Em-dashes sound machine-like.
2. **No marketing jargon:** Never use "synergy," "leverage" (as verb), "holistic," "paradigm shift"
3. **No machine words:** Avoid AI-sounding vocabulary that flags content as automated
4. **Always cite sources:** Every statistic needs a link to the original source
5. **Active voice:** Maximum 20 percent passive voice
6. **Paragraphs under 5 lines:** White space keeps readers moving

---

### AI Header Patterns to Avoid

Do not use these header formats:

- "## Introduction:" or "## Introduction"
- "## Conclusion:" or "## Conclusion"
- "## Overview:"
- "## Final Thought:" or "## Final Takeaway:"
- "## Key Takeaways:"

Instead, use descriptive headers that add value:

- "## The Problem with Traditional Marketing"
- "## What This Means for Your Firm"
- "## Where to Start"

### AI Phrase Patterns to Avoid

- "Let me explain..."
- "Here's what you need to know..."
- "Think of it as..."
- "In this article, we will..."
- "To understand X, we must first..."
- "Without further ado..."
- "It goes without saying..."
- "At the end of the day..."
- "Moving forward..."
- "In today's world..."
- "Now more than ever..."

---

## Legal Marketing Terms

Use these terms consistently:

- **Cost per case** (not cost per acquisition or CPA in legal context)
- **Case acquisition** (not lead generation, when you mean signed clients)
- **Intake** (the process of qualifying and signing clients)
- **Retainer** (the contract, not the fee unless specified)
- **Managing partner** (not "owner" unless quoting)
- **Practice area** (not "legal vertical" or "specialty")

---

- **LEXGRO:** All caps when referring to the company
- **Keith Dunnivant:** Always include full name on first reference
- **Fractional CMO:** Capitalize when referring to the service/role
