## Introduction: The Truth About Law Firm SEO

I've spent the last decade managing SEO and marketing for legal firms—everything from solo practitioners to 50-attorney powerhouses. And I need to be straight with you: most of what you've heard about law firm SEO is either incomplete or just wrong.

Your competitor's marketing agency probably told you that "SEO is the future of client acquisition" and that you need to rank for "personal injury lawyer near me." They're not lying—exactly. But they're also not telling you that you might be throwing $3,000-$5,000 a month at a strategy that won't bring you a single case for six to twelve months. Or longer.

The promise of SEO is real: organic search traffic, sustainable lead generation, calls from people actively looking for your specific legal services. The reality is messier. SEO works for law firms, but not equally for all law firms. The variables are brutal. Your location matters. Your practice area matters. Your budget matters. Whether you're competing against other solo firms or against BigLaw matters.

I've seen solo practitioners in mid-sized markets crack serious case flow from SEO. I've also seen mid-size firms in saturated markets blow $50,000+ without meaningful results. The difference isn't usually the SEO work itself—it's whether the SEO strategy matched the firm's reality.

This guide is different from the SEO fluff you've read before. I'm not here to sell you a service or convince you that SEO is mandatory. I'm here to give you the honest assessment: what actually works now, what doesn't, where the money goes, and what timeline you're really looking at. By the end, you'll know whether law firm SEO makes sense for your situation—and if it does, exactly what to ask for.

## What Is Law Firm SEO? (And Why It's Not All One Thing)

Let me start with the definition, because precision matters here.

SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the practice of making your website more visible in organic search results. For law firms, that typically means Google. You optimize your site so that when someone searches "personal injury lawyer Austin" or "Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing," your firm appears in the results.

But here's where most guides oversimplify: "law firm SEO" actually breaks down into two distinct categories that require different strategies, timelines, and investment levels.

**Local SEO** is the first bucket. This is what happens when someone searches "personal injury lawyer near me" or "DUI attorney in Denver." Google uses location data to show results nearby. If your law firm has a physical office in Denver, you can show up in the local pack—that three-business carousel that appears at the top of Google results. Local SEO focuses on Google Business Profile optimization, local citations, location-specific content, and reviews. It's the fastest path to traffic for most law firms.

**Organic SEO** is the second bucket. This is competing for broader searches—"how much does a divorce cost," "personal injury lawsuit timeline," "tax evasion penalties." These searches aren't location-specific, but they attract clients who are earlier in their legal journey. Ranking for organic searches takes longer but can bring steady, high-intent traffic.

Most law firms actually need both, but they don't need them equally or at the same time.

Here's the breakdown:
- If you're a general practice or trial attorney in a specific city, local SEO is usually your faster win
- If you want to build authority and thought leadership, or serve a regional market, organic SEO is your play
- Enterprise firms and practices with multiple locations often do both simultaneously

The technical execution looks like this: content optimization (making sure your pages answer the questions your clients are actually searching for), technical SEO (making sure Google can crawl and understand your website), link building (getting other reputable websites to link to yours, which signals authority), and local signals optimization (citations, reviews, location data).

It's not complicated conceptually. But executing it well at scale? That's where most law firm SEO breaks down.

## Does SEO Work for Law Firms? The Honest Assessment

Yes. And no. Let me explain why that's not a cop-out.

SEO works for law firms. I have case studies from real firms that have taken it seriously. A commercial litigation firm I worked with in Chicago went from roughly 40 cases/year from digital channels to 130+ cases/year over 24 months. That's SEO working. An estate planning practice in a mid-sized market went from 5-8 planning consultations per month to 20+ within 18 months of launching a comprehensive content strategy. That's real.

But SEO doesn't work equally well in all situations. And the variables that determine whether it works for *your* firm are usually not in your control.

**Competition is the killer variable.** If you're a personal injury attorney in Los Angeles, you're competing against 200+ established firms, BigLaw with massive budgets, and managed services companies that optimize personal injury sites as a business model. Ranking on page one for "personal injury lawyer Los Angeles" might cost $8,000-$15,000 per month and take 18+ months. The client acquisition cost might be $2,000-$5,000 per case. If your average case is worth $50,000+, that math works. If not, you're throwing money away.

If you're a family law attorney in a town of 50,000 people, the competition is three other practices. You can rank for local searches in 4-6 months on a $1,500/month budget. The math is completely different.

**Your practice area matters just as much.** Some practice areas have higher search volume and better conversion rates. Personal injury, criminal defense, DUI, bankruptcy, divorce—these are search-heavy. Clients actively Google them. Some practice areas are quieter. Corporate tax, intellectual property litigation, complex commercial disputes—less Googling, more referrals and networking. SEO will work great for the first group, mediocre for the second.

**Your current digital situation matters.** If you have zero online presence—old website, no content, no citations, no reviews—you're starting from a pit. You'll need longer and more investment to see results. If you already have a decent website with some content and decent reviews, you're already partly there.

**Your budget matters.** You can do SEO on $1,000/month. You can do it on $10,000/month. The difference in timeline, scope, and quality is massive. A solo attorney with a $1,000/month budget might realistically expect meaningful traffic in 9-12 months, in a less competitive market. That same firm in a major city needs $5,000+ monthly to be competitive, and results will take longer.

**Real Results Example:** I worked with a personal injury firm in Austin with three attorneys. They had a website but zero SEO strategy. They started with a local SEO focus: optimized their Google Business Profile, got 50+ quality citations, gathered reviews, and optimized 15 pages of content for local intent. Investment: $2,500/month. Timeline: 7 months to see consistent phone calls; 12 months to meaningful case flow. Today, they attribute 35-40% of their case load to organic search. That's a success story. But this firm was in a market with moderate competition and a straightforward practice area. The math looked good from day one.

**Real Results Example 2:** A complex litigation practice in a major market tried SEO. They invested $4,000/month for 14 months and saw minimal traction. Why? Their clients don't Google "complex litigation attorney." They hire based on reputation and referrals. The firm eventually shifted budget to thought leadership and events. Same firm, completely different need.

So: does SEO work for law firms? Ask yourself:
- What's your market size and competition level?
- Does your client base Google your services?
- Are you patient with 6-12 month timelines?
- Can you commit to ongoing investment?

If you answered yes to all four, SEO will likely work for you. If you answered no to two or more, you might be spinning your wheels.

## How Much Does Law Firm SEO Cost?

Let's talk money, because pricing is where the most deception happens.

You'll see agencies advertising "law firm SEO starting at $499/month." That's not law firm SEO. That's them hoping you won't ask what's included. Real law firm SEO, executed competently, costs money. Here's the breakdown:

| Service Level | Monthly Cost | What's Included |
|---|---|---|
| **Basic/Local** | $1,000-$2,500 | GBP optimization, local citations, basic on-page optimization (5-10 pages), local content, reviews strategy |
| **Mid-Tier** | $2,500-$5,000 | Everything in Basic, plus content creation (4-8 posts/month), link building outreach, technical SEO, keyword research, monthly reporting |
| **Comprehensive** | $5,000-$10,000 | Everything in Mid-Tier, plus aggressive content production (12+ pieces/month), competitive link building, advanced technical optimization, multiple location optimization, conversion optimization |
| **Enterprise** | $10,000+ | Full-service marketing with dedicated team, custom strategy, multi-location/multi-market domination, thought leadership placement, white-label content |

**What determines your level?**

Basic/Local is for firms that are just starting, are in smaller markets with less competition, or want to test whether SEO brings clients. You're focusing on geographic keywords and local pack visibility. This is where I usually recommend starting if you have one location and aren't in a top-20 metro.

Mid-Tier is for established firms with a decent case load that want to grow. You're building content authority, going after longer-tail keywords, and starting to dominate your market. Most firms that see real ROI are at this level. You're expecting 6-12 months to meaningful results.

Comprehensive is for firms that are serious about dominating their market or have multiple locations. You're attacking the market from every angle: local, organic, content, brand. This is what I recommend if you're in a major market and want to compete with established players.

Enterprise is for BigLaw equivalent practices, multi-location firms, and practices that have decided digital is their primary growth channel.

**But here's what's missing from this pricing table: hidden costs.**

Most SEO agencies build the relationship with you on a project basis and then quietly increase scope. They'll charge extra for "priority support," "expedited rankings," "link insertions," "guaranteed placements," or "Ads management integration." Some of these are real work. Some are bullshit. Common hidden costs:

- Content creation overages (if you want more than your package allows)
- Technical SEO work (server issues, site migrations, rebuilds)
- Local SEO for multiple locations (usually charged per location)
- Reputation management (handling negative reviews)
- Conversion rate optimization (making sure traffic actually converts)

When you're vetting agencies, ask: "What's included in your base fee? What costs extra? Are there price increases after the initial contract?" If they're vague, that's a red flag.

One more thing: you're paying for results that don't show up in month one. You're paying for the process—keyword research, content creation, link outreach, technical optimization—with the promise of traffic months later. That's a trust relationship. Make sure you trust the agency.

## How Long Does SEO Take?

This is the question every law firm asks, and every agency answers with "it depends." Which is technically true and completely unhelpful.

Here's the reality: SEO for law firms typically shows meaningful results (traffic you can actually see and that converts to leads) in **6-12 months**, depending on competition and strategy. But "meaningful" has a range.

**Months 1-2: The setup phase.** Nothing visible is happening from the outside, but behind the scenes, a lot is. Keyword research, site audit, content strategy, GBP optimization, citation building. If you're with a good agency, you should be getting regular communication, a documented strategy, and clear benchmarks. If your agency goes dark in months 1-2, that's a problem.

**Months 3-4: Early signals.** You might see your website getting crawled more by Google, a few pages showing up in search results (probably not on page one yet), and some initial local pack visibility if you're doing local SEO. Traffic might be a trickle. Leads are probably zero. Don't panic. This is normal.

**Months 5-7: The waiting game.** This is where most law firms quit. Traffic is starting to increase, but it's still not matching the investment level. You're spending $2,500-$5,000/month and seeing maybe 20-50 organic sessions per week. The ROI math doesn't feel good. But your domain authority is building, your content is accumulating, and your site is becoming more "real" to Google.

**Months 8-12: The acceleration.** If the strategy was sound and the work was quality, this is where you start seeing compounding results. What took two months to get 50 weekly sessions might now be getting 200+ weekly sessions. Some of those sessions convert. You're getting calls from real prospects. Case inquiries start coming through the website. The math starts working.

**Month 12+: The ROI inflection.** By 12-18 months, a well-executed SEO strategy should be delivering consistent traffic that converts to cases. You're no longer asking "is this working?" You're asking "how do we scale this?"

**But this timeline has major caveats:**

If you're in a high-competition market, add 4-6 months to everything. If you're going after competitive keywords, you might not see page-one results for 15-18 months.

If you're in a low-competition market with a clear local focus, you might see real results in 4-5 months.

If your website is currently a disaster (no mobile optimization, slow load times, outdated CMS), expect months 1-3 to be purely defensive—just getting the foundation right.

If you're patient and committed (which most law firms aren't), the timeline gets faster because you're allowing the strategy to work without constantly pivoting.

**From Keith's Perspective:** I've seen law firms fire agencies at month 6 because they expected results and only got process. Then they hire another agency, who has to re-do all the foundational work from scratch. Total waste: 12 months and double the investment. If you're going to do SEO, commit to 12 months minimum. If you can't, don't start.

## Local SEO for Law Firms: Your Fastest Path to Cases

If you're a local service attorney and you're not dominating local SEO, you're leaving money on the table.

Local SEO is where most law firms should start. Here's why: when someone searches "criminal defense attorney near me" or "family law lawyer [your city]," Google shows a local pack (usually three businesses) at the top of the results. Getting into that pack is faster and cheaper than ranking for organic keywords. And the traffic converts better because it's location-specific and high-intent.

**Google Business Profile is your foundation.** This is the listing that shows up in the local pack. Most law firms either have an outdated GBP or don't have one at all. Setting it up properly takes:

- Complete, accurate information (name, address, phone, hours, website)
- Professional photos (your office, team, work environment)
- Regular posts (legal updates, practice area info, links to blog content)
- Service areas clearly defined (if you serve multiple towns, list them)
- Accurate categorization (primary and secondary practice areas)

Updating your GBP properly can take 2-4 weeks of focused work. The payoff is immediate—you'll often see visibility jump within days of a proper setup.

**Citations are the second pillar.** A citation is any mention of your firm's name, address, and phone number (NAP) on another website. Google uses citations as signals of legitimacy and location. You need 50-100+ high-quality citations across relevant directories: legal directories (FindLaw, Avvo, JUSTIA), business directories (Yelp, Yellow Pages, Google), and local directories (chamber of commerce, local business listings). Building quality citations takes 4-8 weeks and costs $500-$1,500 if you outsource it.

**Reviews are the third pillar.** Google shows review count and rating in the local pack. More reviews with a 4.5+ rating signal legitimacy and drive clicks. Asking clients for reviews, managing them, and responding to negative ones is ongoing work. Most law firms ignore this, which is insane. A firm with 100+ reviews with a 4.8 rating has a massive advantage over a competitor with 15 reviews.

**Local content is the fourth pillar.** Creating content that targets local searches: "how divorce works in [county]," "DUI penalties in [state]," "bankruptcy filing process in [city]." This content ranks faster locally and answers the specific questions local prospects are asking.

**Real Results Example:** I worked with a family law firm in a mid-sized market (500,000 people). They had a GBP but it was incomplete. We fixed it, added 75 quality citations, and helped them gather 30 reviews in three months. Their local pack visibility went from occasional position 5-6 to position 1-3 consistently. Traffic to their "consultations" page increased 180% in six months. They went from 8-10 family law consultations per month to 18-22. ROI was immediate.

The key insight: local SEO works because it's less competitive and faster. If you're in a mid-sized market with straightforward practice areas, local SEO should be your first investment. It's typically $1,000-$2,500/month and shows results in 3-6 months.

## SEO vs. PPC for Law Firms: Which Channel Actually Makes Sense?

This is the decision that every law firm faces: organic search (SEO) or paid search (PPC)?

Let me give you the honest comparison:

| Factor | SEO | PPC |
|---|---|---|
| **Time to first lead** | 6-12 months | Days/weeks |
| **Cost per click** | Free (after ranking) | $5-$50+/click |
| **Sustainability** | Builds over time, long-term asset | Stops when budget runs out |
| **Competition** | Increases with more links | Increases with market demand |
| **Predictability** | Low in short term, high after 12+ months | High (you know costs upfront) |
| **Scaling** | Slow/organic growth | Can scale spend immediately |
| **Brand building** | Yes, organic ranks = trust | Limited—transactional |

**The PPC advantage:** If you're a personal injury firm and someone searches "car accident attorney," you can show up in the Google Ads section within hours. You pay per click ($15-$50+ depending on competition). Some percentage converts to cases. You control the volume. It's predictable.

**The SEO advantage:** If that same person searches six months from now, and you own the organic result, you pay nothing for that click. Do that 100 times and you've made back 12 months of SEO investment in a single month.

**My recommendation:**

If you need cases now or your market is so competitive that organic ranking will take 18+ months and massive budget, use PPC. Especially if you have limited local competition and higher-value cases (your PPC CAC needs to be justified by case value).

If you can wait 6-12 months and want to build a sustainable channel that scales, use SEO. Especially if you're in a mid-sized market, have a clear practice area, and your CAC math works.

**From Keith's Perspective:** Most law firms should do both, but sequence them differently. Start with PPC to get immediate cash flow and case familiarity while you build SEO. Once SEO starts producing, reduce PPC in that practice area and reallocate budget. Some firms never reduce PPC—they use it for the high-volume, bottom-funnel searches while SEO owns the awareness and mid-funnel. The best performers I work with use PPC and SEO as complementary channels, not competitors.

## What Good Law Firm SEO Actually Looks Like

If you're going to hire an agency or freelancer to do SEO, you need to know what "good" looks like. Because a lot of bad SEO gets sold as good.

**Good law firm SEO includes:**

- Clear keyword research showing search volume, difficulty, and business potential
- A documented content strategy tied to those keywords
- Monthly reports showing actual traffic, rankings, and conversions (not "impressions" or vanity metrics)
- Transparent communication about what's being done and why
- Regular content production (8-12+ pieces per month for most mid-tier engagements)
- Link building strategy with evidence of work (not backlinks from random sites)
- Technical SEO work with clear documentation of what was fixed
- Local optimization (GBP, citations, reviews) if applicable
- Regular strategy check-ins and refinement based on data

**Red flags that your SEO provider is mediocre or bad:**

- They promise specific rankings or timelines ("we guarantee page-one rankings in 90 days")
- They don't explain their strategy or speak about it in vague terms
- Monthly reports are full of vanity metrics (impressions, reach, domain authority) but light on traffic and conversions
- They don't show you actual content being created or link sources
- They recommend aggressive tactics like private blog networks, PBN links, or "guaranteed link insertion"
- They do all the work behind closed doors and never give you access to your own data
- They frequently change the strategy without explaining why
- They have no clear way to measure ROI

A good agency will show you:
- Exact keywords you're ranking for and where
- Clickthrough rate and traffic from those rankings
- How many of those clicks convert to calls/inquiries
- What content is performing and why
- What links are driving authority
- What's being tested and why

If your provider isn't showing you this, you're flying blind.

**From Keith's Perspective:** I've seen firms get "SEO work" from generalist marketing agencies where it's obvious no one specialized in law firm SEO is doing the work. The strategy is generic (target top-of-funnel keywords, build backlinks, write blog posts), the content is obviously written by someone who doesn't understand law firm clients, and the results are predictable: no cases.

If you hire an agency, make sure someone on their team has specific law firm or legal services experience. The strategies are different. The content is different. The metrics are different.

## DIY vs. Outsourced SEO: What You Should Do Yourself

I have to be honest: most law firm principals should not do SEO themselves.

Not because it's complicated—the tactics are straightforward. But because it requires sustained effort over months, and most busy attorneys have more important things to do. Your time is best spent practicing law and building client relationships.

**That said, there are specific SEO tasks that you can and should do:**

**Update and optimize your Google Business Profile.** Add recent photos, write service descriptions, answer questions in the Q&A section, respond to reviews. This is 30 minutes per week of your time and has direct ROI. Don't outsource this.

**Gather reviews and respond to them.** Email satisfied clients asking for reviews. Respond personally to every review—positive and negative. This is 15 minutes per week. It builds your local authority and shows Google (and prospects) that you're engaged. Don't outsource this.

**Approve and refine content strategy.** Your SEO provider should draft content strategy for your approval. You have insight into what questions clients actually ask, what objections come up, what pain points are real. Use that insight. Spend an hour per month on strategy alignment. This is valuable.

**Monitor KPIs and ask questions.** Don't just trust the reports. Spot-check them. Ask "what's actually happening with traffic to [page]?" Use Google Analytics yourself. Understand the data. 30 minutes per month.

**Tasks you should absolutely outsource:**

- Keyword research (it's tedious and benefits from scale)
- Content writing (unless you want to write it; many attorneys don't have the time or writing style)
- Technical SEO (it requires specific tools and expertise)
- Link building (it's time-intensive and requires relationships)
- GBP citation building (it's administrative grunt work)
- Monthly reporting and analytics (let someone else monitor, you just review)

**Cost-benefit:** A decent SEO specialist or agency costs $1,500-$5,000/month. Your time is worth $200-$500/hour. You can't do competent law firm SEO in 5 hours per week at that rate. You'll spend 10+ hours per week learning, implementing, and maintaining. The outsourced option is almost always cheaper.

**Exception:** If you're a solo attorney with limited budget, very small market, and straightforward practice area, you might DIY local SEO for 3-6 months while you're building. Get the foundation (GBP, citations, reviews) dialed in yourself. But don't pretend you'll maintain serious content and link-building efforts yourself long-term. It won't happen.

## SEO by Practice Area: Quick Reality Check

Not all practice areas have equal SEO opportunity. Here's a quick gut-check for your practice:

**High SEO Opportunity** (lots of search volume, clients actively Google, good conversion rates):
- Personal injury
- DUI/Criminal defense
- Bankruptcy
- Divorce/Family law
- Workers' compensation

These areas have predictable search volume (thousands of searches per month), clients are often first-time legal clients who Google before calling, and case values are usually high enough to support reasonable SEO investment.

**Medium SEO Opportunity** (decent search volume, sometimes Googled, good conversion):
- Employment law
- Real estate
- Immigration
- Contract/small business law
- Probate/Estate planning

These convert well but have less search volume or less search behavior. Local domination is usually achievable but requires more patience.

**Low SEO Opportunity** (limited search volume, rarely Googled, referral-based):
- Complex litigation
- M&A/Corporate law
- Tax law
- Intellectual property
- Administrative law

Clients in these areas almost never Google their attorney choice. They hire based on reputation, referrals, and relationships. SEO is probably a waste of money.

**From Keith's Perspective:** I had a complex litigation attorney ask me about SEO. I asked, "Who found your last five clients?" They were all referrals from other attorneys and existing clients. I said, "Stop wasting money on SEO and invest in referral partnerships and thought leadership instead." That firm pivoted to speaking engagements, bar association involvement, and corporate relationship building. Better results, lower budget, and actually aligned with how their clients hire.

Know your practice area. If you're in high-opportunity territory, SEO is worth serious investment. If you're in low-opportunity territory, you're probably better off with referral marketing, thought leadership, and networking.

## Getting Started: The First Steps

If you've read this far and decided SEO makes sense for your firm, here's what to actually do:

**Step 1: Audit your current situation.** How's your website right now? How many reviews do you have? Any traffic data? What's your GBP look like? You don't need a $5,000 SEO audit—just an honest assessment of where you're starting from.

**Step 2: Define what "success" looks like.** Don't say "get more clients." Say "get 10 additional family law consultation requests per month from organic search within 12 months, with CAC under $800." Be specific. This defines whether SEO actually works for you.

**Step 3: Do your market research.** Look at what's ranking for your core keywords. Check three-five competitors' websites. See if they're winning on SEO (lots of content, recent updates, good rankings) or other channels. This tells you how difficult your market is.

**Step 4: Start with local SEO if you serve a specific geographic area.** Before building national authority, dominate your backyard. GBP optimization, citations, and reviews are your first 90 days.

**Step 5: Decide: DIY, freelancer, or agency.** Budget matters. If you have $1,000/month, you're hiring a freelancer or doing some DIY. If you have $3,000-$5,000/month, you can hire a competent agency. Vet them. Ask for law firm references. Ask what happened with firms in competitive markets. Ask how they measure ROI.

**Step 6: Commit to a 12-month minimum.** Don't start if you're going to quit in month four. You're making a commitment to a process that takes time. Your provider will ask you to trust the process. That trust is only valid if you're patient.

**From Keith's Perspective:** The best outcome I've seen isn't from big budgets. It's from firms that knew why they were doing SEO, were patient with the timeline, and chose quality over price. They hired one good provider and gave them 18 months instead of hiring three bad providers across 12 months. The results speak for themselves.

The worst outcome is firms that treat SEO like a light switch. They turn it on, expect results in 60 days, don't see them, and turn it off. Then they tell everyone "SEO doesn't work for law firms." It wasn't SEO that didn't work. It was the approach.

## FAQ: Real Questions Law Firms Ask

**Q: Can I rank for "lawyer" or "attorney" in my city?**
A: Unlikely, unless you're in a town of 20,000 people. These are impossibly broad keywords with national competition. Instead, rank for "[practice area] lawyer [city]." Personal injury attorney Austin. DUI defense Denver. That's achievable.

**Q: How many leads should I expect per month?**
A: Depends entirely on your market and keywords. A family law firm in a mid-sized market might expect 20-40 leads per month after 12 months at mid-tier investment. A personal injury firm in a major city might expect 50+ after 18 months with higher investment. Not all leads convert. Assume 10-20% conversion rate.

**Q: SEO might be a terrible idea if you're a solo or small firm in a big city, right?**
A: Generally yes. The competition in major markets is brutal. A solo in LA trying to rank for "personal injury lawyer" is fighting massive agencies and BigLaw. It's possible but requires $5,000-$10,000+/month and 18+ months. Your CAC might end up so high that it doesn't work. A solo in a smaller market has much better odds.

**Q: Is Google Business Profile really that important?**
A: Yes. If you have a physical location, your GBP is often more important than your website for local search. It's the first thing most people see. Keep it updated and complete.

**Q: Should I hire a generalist marketing agency or SEO specialist?**
A: Specialist. Law firm marketing is specific. The content strategy is different. The buyer journey is different. A generalist agency might do acceptable work, but a specialist with law firm experience will do better work faster.

**Q: How do I know if my SEO provider is actually working?**
A: Look at actual organic traffic to your website and conversion of that traffic to leads. Not rankings. Not backlinks. Not domain authority. Traffic and leads. If you're getting 50+ organic sessions per week after 6 months and some are converting, your provider is working. If you're getting 10 sessions and zero leads, something's wrong.

**Q: What about content? How much do I actually need?**
A: For local SEO dominance, 15-25 core pages optimized well beats 100 pages of mediocre content. For competitive national markets, you'll eventually need 50-100+ pages. Start with quality over quantity.

**Q: Do I need links if I'm just doing local SEO?**
A: Less critical locally. A strong GBP, good citations, and content beat links for local pack visibility. For organic SEO, links are essential. Quality matters way more than quantity. 10 links from relevant, authoritative sites beat 100 from random sites.

**Q: How do I keep doing SEO after my agency contract ends?**
A: Depends on your agency. Good agencies set you up to maintain the basics yourself (GBP, reviews, content refresh) with light-touch help. Bad agencies make you completely dependent on them for everything and charge accordingly. Ask about the "hand-off plan" during onboarding.

**Q: Is PPC cheaper than SEO for law firms?**
A: Short-term, no. PPC gets results immediately but costs more per case. Long-term, SEO is cheaper because you build an asset that generates free traffic. Hybrid approach: PPC gets you quick revenue and data, SEO builds your sustainable channel.

**Q: What's the #1 mistake law firms make with SEO?**
A: Expecting too much too soon and abandoning it. They're not patient enough. They hire an agency, spend $3,000/month, see zero results in month two, and cancel. Then they say "SEO doesn't work." They needed to trust the timeline and commit to 12 months minimum.

## Conclusion: The Next Step

Law firm SEO works. But it works best for firms that understand what they're getting into.

If you're in a mid-sized market with a straightforward practice area and can commit to 12 months, SEO is one of the best investments you can make. The ROI compounds over time. You build an asset that brings clients for years.

If you're a solo in a major competitive market with limited budget, you might be better off with PPC and referral marketing while you build your reputation.

If your clients don't Google their attorney choice, SEO is probably a waste of money. Invest in thought leadership, referrals, and relationships instead.

The key insight from my decade in this space: the firms winning at SEO aren't the ones with the biggest budgets. They're the ones with realistic expectations, patient timelines, and clear measurement. They know why they're doing it, they know what success looks like, and they commit to the process.

That's the difference between SEO that works and SEO that's a waste of money.
