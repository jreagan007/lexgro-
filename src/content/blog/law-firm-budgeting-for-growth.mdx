# Law Firm Budgeting for Growth

Growth costs money. But not all spending drives growth. The difference is strategy.

Here's how to budget for actual growth, not just expenses.

## The Growth Budget Mindset

Most firms budget reactively. Last year we spent X, this year we'll spend X plus a bit more.

Growth budgeting is different. Start with where you want to go. Then work backward to figure out what it takes to get there.

If you want to add $500,000 in revenue next year, what does that require?

- How many new cases?
- What cost per acquisition?
- What marketing investment?
- What operational capacity?

Budget flows from strategy, not habit.

## Categories That create growth

### Marketing

Marketing is the growth engine. Without clients, nothing else matters.

Budget marketing as a percentage of target revenue, not current revenue. Growing firms typically invest 5-10 percent of revenue in marketing.

Within marketing, prioritize:

1. Tracking infrastructure (measure before you spend)
2. Website optimization (convert the traffic you have)
3. Paid acquisition (predictable lead flow)
4. SEO and content (long-term traffic)

### Technology

The right technology makes growth scalable. The wrong technology limits it.

Invest in:

- Practice management software
- CRM for tracking leads and clients
- Automation where it saves time
- Communication tools that work

Avoid shiny objects. Technology should solve problems, not create them.

### People

Growth requires people. Budget for:

- Hiring costs
- Training and development
- Competitive compensation
- Additional staff as capacity needs grow

Underpaying creates turnover. Turnover kills growth.

### Professional Development

Better attorneys generate more revenue. Invest in:

- CLE and training
- Coaching and mentorship
- Industry conferences
- Skill development

## What to Cut

Growth budgeting isn't just about spending more. It's about spending smart.

Cut or reduce:

- Underperforming marketing channels
- Technology you don't use
- Subscriptions you forgot about
- Overhead that doesn't support growth

Every dollar freed up can be reinvested in what works.

## The Numbers

Here's a framework for a growing law firm:

| Category | % of Revenue |
|----------|-------------|
| Marketing | 5-10 percent |
| Technology | 2-4 percent |
| Professional development | 1-2 percent |
| Growth reserve | 2-5 percent |

Adjust based on your situation. A firm in aggressive growth mode might spend 15 percent on marketing. A firm optimizing operations might spend more on technology.

## Planning for Uncertainty

Growth isn't linear. Good months and bad months happen.

Build reserves:

- Operating expenses for 2-3 months
- Marketing flexibility budget
- Opportunity fund for unexpected possibilities

Cash reserves provide the stability that enables risk-taking.

## Review and Adjust

Budgets are plans, not contracts. Review monthly.

- What's working better than expected?
- What's underperforming?
- Where should we shift resources?

The best budget is one that evolves based on results.

## The Bottom Line

Budgeting for growth means investing in what drives growth. Marketing. Technology. People. And cutting what doesn't.

Start with where you want to go. Budget to get there. Measure and adjust.

Growth isn't free. But it's a good investment.
