# Attorney Facebook Ads: Maximize Your ROI

Facebook advertising for law firms can work brilliantly or fail completely. The difference is usually in the strategy.

Here's how to make Facebook ads actually work for your practice.

## When Facebook Ads Make Sense

Facebook is fundamentally different from Google.

On Google, people are actively searching for a lawyer. High intent. Ready to hire.

On Facebook, people are scrolling past cat videos and birthday posts. Low intent. Not thinking about legal problems.

This means Facebook works differently. You're not capturing demand. You're creating it.

That works for some situations:

- **Building awareness** before people need you
- **Retargeting** people who visited your website
- **Reaching specific demographics** Google can't target
- **Practice areas with longer consideration cycles** like estate planning

It works less well for:

- Emergency legal needs (criminal defense, accidents)
- High-intent searches where Google dominates
- Complex B2B legal services

## Targeting That Works

Facebook's power is in targeting. You can reach Highly specific audiences.

### Demographic Targeting

Target by:

- Age
- Location
- Homeownership
- Income level
- Life events (new job, newly engaged, new baby)

Life events are particularly powerful for legal marketing. Someone who just got engaged might need a prenup. Someone who just had a baby might need estate planning.

### Interest-Based Targeting

Target people interested in:

- Related topics (parenting for family law, finance for estate planning)
- Competitors
- Legal information

### Lookalike Audiences

Upload your client list. Facebook finds similar people. These lookalike audiences often perform well because they share characteristics with your existing clients.

### Retargeting

Show ads to people who:

- Visited your website
- Engaged with your Facebook page
- Watched your videos
- Submitted forms but didn't hire

Retargeting audiences are warm. They already know you. Conversion rates are typically higher.

## Ad Creative That Converts

### Lead with Value

Nobody cares about your firm. They care about their problems.

**Weak:** "Smith Law Firm has 20 years of experience in family law."

**Strong:** "Worried about protecting your kids in a divorce? Here's what you need to know."

Start with the problem. Then offer the solution.

### Use Video

Video outperforms static images on Facebook. It stops the scroll and builds trust.

Video doesn't mean expensive production. Simple, authentic content often works better than polished commercials.

Ideas:

- Attorney explaining a common legal question
- Client testimonials
- Behind-the-scenes at the firm

### Clear Call to Action

Every ad needs a clear next step.

- Schedule a free consultation
- Download a free guide
- Watch this video
- Learn more

Don't make people guess what to do next.

## Landing Pages Matter

The ad gets the click. The landing page gets the conversion.

Don't send Facebook traffic to your homepage. Create dedicated landing pages that:

- Match the ad's message
- Load fast on mobile
- Have a single, clear call to action
- Include trust elements (reviews, credentials)

The best Facebook campaigns fail if landing pages don't convert.

## Budgeting Realistically

Facebook advertising requires sufficient budget to learn and optimize.

Minimum viable budget: $1,000-2,000 per month per campaign

Below that, you don't generate enough data to optimize effectively. You're just burning money.

As you find what works, scale budget toward winning campaigns and away from losers.

## Measuring Results

Track what matters:

- Cost per click
- Cost per lead
- Lead quality (what percentage become consultations?)
- Cost per consultation
- Cost per signed case

Facebook's reporting shows vanity metrics. Reach. Impressions. Engagement. None of that matters if it doesn't translate to cases.

Connect Facebook to your CRM. Track the full journey from ad impression to signed client.

## Common Mistakes

### Targeting Too Broadly

A million-person audience sounds good but wastes money. Narrow targeting reaches people more likely to need your services.

### Expecting Immediate Results

Facebook is a long game. You're building awareness and trust over time. Don't expect Google-like instant leads.

### Weak Creative

Boring ads get ignored. Invest in creative that stops the scroll and communicates value.

### No Retargeting

Retargeting is usually your highest-ROI Facebook campaign. If you're not retargeting website visitors, you're missing easy wins.

### Poor Landing Pages

A great ad leading to a bad landing page is money wasted. Invest as much in conversion as in traffic.

## A Sample Strategy

Here's how I typically structure Facebook for law firms.

**Campaign 1: Awareness**
Target: Lookalike of existing clients
Creative: Educational video content
Goal: Introduce the firm to new audiences
Budget: 40 percent of total

**Campaign 2: Retargeting**
Target: Website visitors who didn't convert
Creative: Testimonials and social proof
Goal: Convert warm leads
Budget: 30 percent of total

**Campaign 3: Lead Generation**
Target: Life events and interests relevant to practice area
Creative: Lead magnet (free guide, checklist)
Goal: Capture contact information
Budget: 30 percent of total

This structure builds awareness, captures leads, and converts warm audiences.

## The Bottom Line

Facebook advertising can work for law firms, but it requires realistic expectations and strategic execution.

It's not a replacement for Google. It's a complement. It builds awareness, nurtures leads, and captures audiences Google can't reach.

Done right, Facebook becomes a steady source of qualified leads at reasonable costs. Done wrong, it's an expensive lesson.
