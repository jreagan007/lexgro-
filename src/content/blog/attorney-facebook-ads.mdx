Facebook and Instagram advertising delivers a [29% ROI for legal services](https://gladiatorlawmarketing.com/digital-marketing-statistics-law-firms-2025/), the highest return of any social media platform for law firms. About 62% of firms maintain an active Facebook presence, but only 33% use the platform daily for marketing. That gap between presence and execution is where most of the opportunity sits.

The firms generating consistent leads from Facebook do three things right: they use lead generation campaign objectives, they build custom audiences from real client data, and they design creative for mobile screens first. Everything else is detail.

## Why Lead Generation Campaigns Outperform Everything Else

Most law firms running Facebook ads choose the wrong campaign objective. They select traffic or engagement, send people to their website, and wonder why nobody converts.

According to [Focus Digital's 2025 CTR benchmark data](https://focus-digital.co/facebook-ads-ctr-benchmarks-2025-data/), lead generation campaigns deliver a 2.53% click-through rate. Traffic and link click campaigns hit just 1.57%. That is a 61% performance gap from changing one setting.

Lead generation campaigns work differently than traffic campaigns. Instead of sending people to your website, they open a native form inside Facebook or Instagram. The prospect fills out their name, phone number, and a brief description of their legal issue without ever leaving the platform. Facebook auto-fills most fields from their profile data, reducing friction to almost zero.

The legal services category averages a 1.61% CTR overall, which ranks as average across 16 industries. Choosing the lead generation objective raises your performance above that baseline immediately. You are not competing against "average law firm Facebook ads." You are competing against the small percentage of firms that have figured out the right objective.

## Three Custom Audiences That Actually Convert

Facebook's targeting power comes from custom audiences. Generic demographic targeting wastes money. Custom audiences built from real data convert.

### Audience 1: Website Visitors Who Did Not Convert

Install the Meta pixel on your website. Build an audience of everyone who visited your practice area pages but did not reach your thank-you or confirmation page. These people showed interest but did not take action.

Retarget them within a [14-day window](https://www.uproas.io/blog/facebook-ads-statistics). After two weeks, most prospects have either hired another firm or moved on. Your retargeting ads should address the reason they did not convert the first time. Common angles include social proof (reviews and results), addressing objections (cost concerns), and urgency (statute of limitations).

### Audience 2: Lookalike Audiences From Past Clients

Upload your signed client email list to Facebook. The platform's algorithm finds people with similar characteristics, demographics, behaviors, and interests. These lookalike audiences often produce the lowest cost per lead because they mirror the people who have already hired you.

Start with your conversion pixel data, not form submissions. Pixel-based lookalikes optimize for people who take the final action (calling, submitting), not just people who click. If your pixel has fewer than 100 conversions, supplement with your email list.

[Meta's Andromeda algorithm](https://www.practiceproof.com/why-your-law-firm-needs-to-do-facebook-meta-ads-in-2026/) now identifies hidden intent signals beyond explicit search behavior. The algorithm can find prospects showing patterns that correlate with legal need, even when those prospects have not searched for a lawyer. Broader targeting with algorithmic optimization now outperforms narrow manual targeting in most cases.

### Audience 3: Practice-Area-Specific Segments

Different practice areas require different targeting.

- **Family law:** Parents aged 30 to 55, recently changed relationship status, interest in co-parenting resources
- **Estate planning:** Adults 55+, homeowners, interest in retirement planning and wealth management
- **Personal injury:** Broader demographic targeting with interest in accident-related content, health and wellness
- **Criminal defense:** Harder to target directly. Use geographic targeting around court locations combined with age and income demographics.

The temptation is to make audiences extremely narrow. Resist that. [Overly restrictive targeting misses up to 33%](https://www.practiceproof.com/why-your-law-firm-needs-to-do-facebook-meta-ads-in-2026/) of high-intent prospects that the algorithm would have found on its own. Set reasonable parameters and let the algorithm optimize within them.

## Mobile-First Creative Is Not Optional

Here is a number that should change how you design ads: [94 to 98% of Facebook and Instagram traffic comes from mobile devices](https://focus-digital.co/facebook-ads-ctr-benchmarks-2025-data/). Mobile click-through rates run 33 to 52% higher than desktop.

If you are designing ads on a desktop monitor and hoping they look fine on phones, you are optimizing for 2 to 6% of your audience.

### Placement Performance by Format

Each placement type performs differently. Understanding the numbers helps you allocate budget.

- **Instagram Stories:** 1.34% CTR (highest engagement quality)
- **Facebook Feed:** 1.11% CTR (stable volume, proven for consultation booking)
- **Facebook Reels:** 0.94% CTR, but 10 to 30% cheaper CPM (cost per thousand impressions)

Reels deliver fewer clicks per impression but cost significantly less to serve. For firms with limited budgets, Reels offer the best reach per dollar. Stories deliver the most engaged prospects. Feed placements provide the most predictable conversion volume.

### Video Dominates Static Creative

Video ads generate 1.94 to 3.0% click-through rates across Facebook and Instagram. Static image ads produce the lowest CTR of any format and work primarily for brand awareness, not lead generation.

Your video creative needs three elements.

**Vertical format (9:16 aspect ratio).** Mobile screens are tall, not wide. Horizontal video wastes screen space and looks like an afterthought.

**Bold text overlays.** Most people watch video without sound. If your message only exists in audio, most of your audience will never hear it. Add text that communicates the key message visually.

**Pattern interrupt in the first three seconds.** The scroll is fast. Your opening frame needs to stop the thumb. Start with a bold claim, a surprising statistic, or a provocative question. "Did you know 39% of law firms never respond to online leads?" stops the scroll. "Smith and Associates has been serving clients since 1987" does not.

### Creative Formats Ranked

Based on the [benchmark data](https://focus-digital.co/facebook-ads-ctr-benchmarks-2025-data/), here is how creative formats perform for legal services.

- **Video ads:** Best for explaining legal concepts and building trust. Highest engagement.
- **Lead generation ads:** Best for capturing contact information with minimal friction. Highest conversion.
- **Carousel ads:** Good for highlighting multiple practice areas or attorney profiles. Medium engagement.
- **Single image ads:** Lowest CTR. Use only for brand awareness. Not recommended for lead generation.

## Budget Allocation Across Placements

A starting budget allocation that works for most firms.

- **40 to 50% to Reels:** Despite lower CTR, the CPM advantage and growing platform momentum make this the best value for awareness and reach.
- **30% to Instagram Stories:** Highest engagement quality for legal services. Best for retargeting warm audiences.
- **20 to 30% to Feed placements:** Stable volume. Proven conversion for consultation booking. Best for lead generation campaigns.

The [standard platform split is 60% Facebook and 40% Instagram](https://www.uproas.io/blog/facebook-ads-statistics). Test this starting ratio and adjust based on your practice area. Estate planning may perform better on Facebook (older demographic). Personal injury may perform better on Instagram (broader reach).

## Retargeting Sequences That Close Cases

Cold audiences see your firm for the first time. They are not ready to hire. Retargeting audiences already know who you are. They just need the right message at the right time.

Build four retargeting sequences.

**Website visitors (14-day window).** Show testimonials, case results, and trust-building content. Address the most common objection for your practice area.

**Lead form submitters (7-day window).** These prospects gave you their information but did not book a consultation. Offer a specific incentive: "Schedule your free 15-minute case review this week." Address common objections directly in the ad copy.

**Consultation no-shows (3-day window).** Life gets in the way. A simple "We missed you. Let's reschedule" message with a direct booking link recovers a meaningful percentage of missed appointments.

**Past clients (ongoing).** Cross-sell additional services. A family law client may need estate planning. A business formation client may need employment counsel. These audiences convert at the highest rates because they already trust your firm.

## Measuring What Matters

Facebook's default reporting shows reach, impressions, and engagement. None of those metrics tell you whether your campaigns produce cases.

Track these numbers instead.

- **Cost per lead:** The benchmark varies by practice area, but Facebook generally delivers leads at [significantly lower cost than Google Ads](/blog/ways-to-reduce-cost-per-case-acquisition/).
- **Lead-to-consultation rate:** What percentage of Facebook leads book and attend consultations?
- **Cost per consultation:** Divide your Facebook spend by the number of attended consultations.
- **Cost per signed case:** The only number that determines whether Facebook is profitable for your firm.

Connect Facebook to your CRM. Track the full journey from ad impression to signed client. About [28% of legal marketers rank Facebook as their top paid social platform](https://seoprofy.com/blog/legal-marketing-statistics/). The ones getting results track beyond the click.

## Launch Your First Lead Generation Campaign

If you have never run Facebook ads for your firm, or if you have run them poorly, here is a 24-hour launch plan.

**Pick one practice area.** Do not run a general "hire our firm" campaign. Choose family law, personal injury, estate planning, or criminal defense. One area, one campaign.

**Build three audiences.** Website visitor retargeting, a lookalike based on your client list, and one demographic audience based on practice-area targeting.

**Create one video ad.** Vertical, 30 to 45 seconds, problem-solution format. Open with the problem your clients face. Show how your firm solves it. End with a clear call to action.

**Set the lead generation objective.** Not traffic. Not engagement. Lead generation. Build a simple native form with four fields: name, phone, email, and one qualifying question.

**Enable Advantage+ placements.** Let the algorithm distribute your ad across Facebook Feed, Instagram Feed, Stories, and Reels. It will optimize toward the placements that perform best for your audience.

**Set a budget of at least $1,500 per month.** Below that threshold, Meta's algorithm does not collect enough data to optimize effectively. The platform needs roughly 50 conversions per week to learn.

After two weeks, check cost per lead. After 30 days, check lead quality and consultation booking rates. After 60 days, you will have enough data to know whether Facebook works for your practice area and market.
