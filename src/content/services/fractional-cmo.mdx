# Fractional CMO Services for Law Firms

Your law firm needs marketing leadership. You just don't need to pay $300,000 a year for it.

LEXGRO's fractional CMO services give you executive-level marketing strategy, vendor oversight, and measurable growth at a fraction of full-time cost. You get the strategic brain that transforms marketing from a cost center into a growth engine.

## The Problem: Marketing Without Leadership

Most law firms I work with have the same complaint. They're spending $10,000, $20,000, even $50,000 per month on marketing. But they can't tell you which dollars are bringing in cases. They can't predict next month's intake numbers. And they certainly can't explain why some months are great and others are terrible.

The agencies send reports. The vendors show activity. Everyone looks busy. But nobody's asking the hard questions: Is this working? What's our actual cost per case? Are these vendors earning their fees?

That's not a marketing problem. That's a leadership problem.

Agencies execute tactics. They don't set strategy. Having an SEO agency doesn't mean you have marketing leadership any more than having a paralegal means you have legal strategy.

You need someone sitting above all of it. Coordinating. Measuring. Holding people accountable. Connecting marketing activities to business outcomes.

## The Solution: Strategic Marketing Leadership

A fractional CMO brings the leadership layer that's missing. Not someone doing the daily work. Someone making sure the daily work gets done correctly and moves toward your goals.

Here's what that looks like in practice.

### Strategy Development

Every marketing decision should flow from strategy. Without it, you're just doing random activities and hoping something works.

I start every engagement by answering fundamental questions:

- Who are your ideal clients and where do they look for help?
- What makes your firm different from competitors?
- Which practice areas deserve more investment?
- How should your budget be allocated across channels?
- What does success look like and how do we measure it?

The answers become a 12-month marketing roadmap. Every future decision filters through this strategy. No more random tactics. No more guessing.

For a complete overview of effective law firm marketing, see our [guide covering channels, budgets, and ROI tracking](/guide/law-firm-marketing/).

### Vendor Management

You probably work with multiple marketing vendors. SEO agency. PPC manager. Website developer. Content writer. Social media person.

Who's making sure they're all rowing in the same direction? Who's checking their work? Who's asking the uncomfortable questions?

I run the marketing team meeting. I review the reports. I hold vendors accountable for results, not just activities. When vendors know someone who understands their work watches them, performance improves.

When a vendor underperforms, I catch it and fix it. When a vendor excels, I double down on what's working.

### Performance Tracking

You can't improve what you don't measure. But most law firms measure the wrong things.

Impressions don't matter. Website visits don't matter. Social media likes don't matter.

What matters is cost per lead. Cost per consultation. Cost per signed case. Marketing ROI.

I implement tracking systems that connect marketing activities to business outcomes. With this data, decision-making becomes straightforward: spend more on what works, less on what doesn't.

### Team Development

Maybe you have marketing staff. Maybe they're good at execution but weak on strategy. Maybe they need direction and development.

I work with your team to raise their game. I teach them how to evaluate campaigns. I show them what good performance looks like. I give them frameworks for making better decisions.

When our engagement ends, your team is stronger than when we started.

### Executive Partnership

Marketing decisions intersect with business decisions. Pricing. Positioning. Practice area development. Geographic expansion. Growth planning.

I participate in these conversations at the executive level. I bring the marketing perspective to leadership discussions. I translate business goals into marketing plans and marketing results back into business outcomes.

## What's Included

We customize every engagement to your firm's needs. Here is what you can expect at different levels.

### Standard Engagement ($8,000 to $12,000/month)

Most firms start here. This provides comprehensive marketing leadership.

**Strategy and Planning:**
- Complete marketing audit in month one
- 12-month marketing strategy and roadmap
- Quarterly strategy reviews and adjustments
- Budget allocation recommendations

**Ongoing Leadership:**
- Weekly strategy sessions with your team
- Vendor coordination and oversight
- Performance tracking and reporting
- Campaign optimization recommendations

**Team Support:**
- Training for internal marketing staff
- Frameworks and best practices
- Hiring guidance when needed

**Time Commitment:** 15 to 25 hours per month

### Light Engagement ($5,000 to $7,000/month)

For firms that need strategic guidance but less hands-on involvement.

**Includes:**
- Initial marketing audit
- Marketing strategy development
- Monthly strategy sessions
- Vendor oversight and accountability
- Performance reporting

**Time Commitment:** 10 to 15 hours per month

**Includes everything in Standard, plus:**
- Multiple weekly touchpoints
- Deeper vendor management
- Project management for major initiatives
- Expanded team training

**Time Commitment:** 25 to 40 hours per month

## How It Works

Every engagement follows a structured process designed to deliver results.

### Phase 1: Discovery and Audit (Month 1)

**Week 1 to 2: Discovery**

I meet with partners and key stakeholders to understand your firm: history, goals, constraints, and what success looks like. I review your marketing materials, messaging, and competitive positioning. I document your ideal client profiles and target case types.

**Week 3 to 4: Audit**

I review every marketing dollar you're spending. I analyze campaign performance data. I interview your vendors and internal staff. I identify gaps in tracking and measurement. I document everything: what's working, what's not, and where the opportunities are.

**Deliverable:** Comprehensive audit report with findings and recommendations.

### Phase 2: Strategy Development (Month 2 to 3)

Based on the audit, I develop your marketing strategy.

**Strategy Components:**
- Target client definition and segmentation
- Positioning and messaging framework
- Channel strategy and budget allocation
- Vendor evaluation and recommendations
- KPIs and measurement plan
- 12-month roadmap with quarterly milestones

**Deliverable:** Complete marketing strategy document and 12-month action plan.

### Phase 3: Execution and Optimization (Month 4+)

With strategy set, the focus shifts to execution and ongoing improvement.

**Ongoing Activities:**
- Weekly or biweekly strategy sessions
- Vendor coordination and management
- Performance tracking and reporting
- Campaign optimization
- Team training and development
- Quarterly strategy reviews

I don't do the daily work. I make sure the daily work gets done correctly and moves toward your goals.

## What Results Can You Expect?

Industry research shows firms using fractional marketing leadership achieve [25 to 35% higher marketing ROI](https://www.fisher-marketing.com/post/fisher-marketing-expands-fractional-cmo-services-in-2026) within 12 months. They also see [48% faster time-to-market](https://www.fisher-marketing.com/post/fisher-marketing-expands-fractional-cmo-services-in-2026) for new services and campaigns.

Here's what I've seen with the firms I work with.

**A personal injury firm** was spending $25,000 per month with no idea what was working. After implementing tracking and reallocating budget from underperformers to performers, their cost per case dropped 40%. Same budget, twice the cases.

**A family law firm** was drowning in low-quality leads. Strategic repositioning and better targeting reduced lead volume by 30% but increased average case value by 60%. Total revenue increased 40% with less stress on staff.

**An immigration practice** wanted to scale from solo to multi-attorney firm. We built the marketing infrastructure to support that growth: strategy, systems, processes. Revenue grew from $500,000 to $1.2 million in 18 months.

Results take time. Expect foundation work in months one and two. Initial improvements in months three to four. Meaningful ROI impact within six to twelve months.

## Why LEXGRO?

I've spent 15 years working with law firms on marketing strategy and execution. I've seen what works and what doesn't across hundreds of firms and every practice area.

**Legal marketing expertise:** I understand the unique challenges of legal marketing: ethical constraints, high-value clients, long sales cycles, intense competition. General marketing tactics don't work here. You need someone who knows the terrain.

**Results focus:** I measure success by your growth, not my activities. I track cost per case, not impressions. I'm accountable for outcomes, not deliverables.

**Strategic thinking:** I don't just execute tactics. I set direction. I ask hard questions. I make decisions that produce measurable growth.

**Honest communication:** I tell you what you need to hear, not what you want to hear. If a vendor isn't performing, I'll tell you. If a channel is wasting money, I'll tell you. If your strategy needs to change, I'll tell you.

**Aligned interests:** I succeed when you succeed. My reputation depends on your results. That alignment drives everything I do.

## Is This Right for Your Firm?

Fractional CMO services work best for law firms that:

- Generate $1 million to $20 million in annual revenue
- Spend at least $5,000 per month on marketing
- Lack clarity on marketing ROI
- Have vendors operating without strategic oversight
- Have committed to growth

This isn't right for firms that:

- Aren't willing to invest in marketing
- Want someone to execute tasks rather than set strategy
- Aren't open to changing how they do things
- Expect overnight results

The firms I work with share a common trait: they're committed to growth and willing to trust expert guidance while holding me accountable for results.

## Common Questions

**How is this different from hiring an agency?**

Agencies execute tactics. I set strategy and provide oversight. Most firms I work with keep their agencies. I make those agencies more effective by providing direction, coordination, and accountability. Read more about what a fractional CMO does versus traditional agencies.

**How is this different from hiring a full-time CMO?**

A full-time CMO costs $300,000 to $450,000 per year including salary, benefits, and overhead. I provide similar strategic value at a fraction of the cost. For firms under $10 million in revenue, the fractional model usually makes more sense economically.

**How much time will you spend with my firm?**

Depends on the engagement level. Light engagements run 10 to 15 hours per month. Standard engagements run 15 to 25 hours. Intensive engagements run 25 to 40 hours. We'll match the commitment to your needs.

**What if I already have marketing staff?**

Great. I'll work with them. I provide the strategic direction they need to be more effective. Your team gets better, not replaced.

**What if I'm not satisfied?**

I offer a 30-day satisfaction guarantee. If you're not seeing value after the first month, you can cancel with no penalty. I only want to work with firms where the relationship is working for both of us.

**How quickly will I see results?**

Most firms see measurable improvements within 90 days. Significant revenue impact typically takes 6 to 12 months. Marketing is a marathon, not a sprint. But I'll show you progress along the way.

## Ready to Talk?

If your firm is spending money on marketing but not seeing the results you want, we should talk.

I'll share what I see in your current marketing. You'll share your goals and challenges. Together, we'll determine if working together makes sense.

No hard sell. No pressure. Just a conversation about your firm's growth.
