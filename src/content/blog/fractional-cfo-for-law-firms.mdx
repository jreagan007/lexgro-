Most law firms have a bookkeeper who records transactions and an accountant who files taxes. That handles compliance. It does not handle strategy.

Strategic financial questions go unanswered. Which practice areas are actually profitable after accounting for attorney time? What cash reserves does the firm need to weather a slow quarter? When can you afford to hire the next associate? How should partner compensation change as the firm grows?

A fractional CFO answers these questions at a fraction of the cost of a full-time hire. The average fractional CFO engagement costs about $96,000 per year. A full-time CFO costs $345,000 to $555,000 when you factor in salary, benefits, and payroll taxes (GetExact, 2025). That is a savings of $249,000 to $459,000 annually.

## What a Fractional CFO Does (That Your Accountant Does Not)

A bookkeeper records what happened. An accountant checks accuracy and files taxes. A CFO tells you what to do next.

The difference is strategic versus transactional. Your accountant looks backward at completed transactions. A CFO looks forward at financial projections, cash flow models, and profitability trends. Different level of thinking entirely.

Typical engagements run 10 to 40 hours per month at $3,000 to $15,000 monthly. The scope depends on firm size:

- **$5 million to $10 million revenue:** 10 to 15 hours per month for profitability analysis and cash flow management
- **$10 million to $25 million revenue:** 20 to 30 hours per month for ongoing strategy and KPI tracking
- **Over $25 million revenue:** 30 to 40 hours for full financial leadership and M&A preparation

## The Cash Flow Problem at Growing Law Firms

Cash flow problems kill law firms. Even profitable firms can fail if cash runs out at the wrong time.

Personal injury firms carry cases for months or years before collecting. Contingent fee structures create long gaps between expenses and revenue. Aged receivables pile up. The firm looks profitable on paper but cannot make payroll.

Firms with fractional CFO oversight report 15 to 25% cash flow improvement within the first three months of engagement (GetExact, 2025). One personal injury firm gained $2.3 million in working capital within 12 months through better collection processes. That is money that would have been written off without active management.

A CFO manages cash flow through forecasting cash needs 6 to 12 months ahead, accelerating billing and collection cycles, timing major expenses around revenue patterns, arranging appropriate lines of credit, and building reserves for contingencies.

You should never be surprised by a cash crisis. Good financial management sees problems coming months in advance.

## Profitability Analysis by Practice Area

Not all revenue is equal. A $10,000 case that takes 50 attorney hours is not the same as a $10,000 case that takes 10 hours.

Many firms discover that 30% of their work generates 70% of their profits. Knowing which 30% changes everything about how you allocate marketing spend, hire attorneys, and accept cases.

A fractional CFO analyzes profitability by practice area, attorney, case type, client segment, and [marketing channel](/guide/law-firm-marketing/). This analysis reveals where to invest and where to cut.

Industry benchmarks provide targets: realization rates should hit 85 to 95%, and collection rates should reach 90 to 98% (TL Turner Group, 2025). A CFO measures your firm against these benchmarks and identifies the gaps costing you money.

## The KPI Dashboard That Changes Decisions

Most law firm financial reports are backward-looking summaries. They show what happened last month. They do not tell you what to do about it.

A fractional CFO builds reporting that drives decisions. The dashboard tracks billing realization rates, collections aging, attorney utilization, and profitability by practice area in real time.

Firms with strong financial reporting achieve 85 to 95% forecast precision (GetExact, 2025). That accuracy means you can make confident decisions about hiring, expansion, and investment instead of guessing.

The shift from aggregated reporting (one number for the whole firm) to practice-area and attorney-level breakdowns reveals where losses hide. You might discover that one practice area subsidizes another, or that a high-billing attorney actually loses money after accounting for their support costs.

## Compensation Design and Partner Economics

How you pay attorneys shapes their behavior. Get compensation wrong and you create misaligned incentives. Partners hoard origination credit. Associates avoid complex cases. The firm loses money while individual attorneys appear to perform well.

A fractional CFO helps design compensation using objective scoring that accounts for origination, collections, management contributions, and profitability. This aligns individual incentives with firm goals.

The stakes are high. A mid-sized firm with $5 million in revenue and five partners is allocating $2 million to $3 million in partner compensation. Getting that allocation right (or wrong) by even 10% represents $200,000 to $300,000 in misallocated funds.

## Legal-Specific Financial Strategy

Law firms have financial needs that general CFOs miss.

**Trust accounting and IOLTA compliance.** Mishandling trust accounts can result in bar discipline. A CFO with legal industry experience structures trust accounting to prevent violations.

**Contingency fee modeling.** Personal injury and other contingency-fee practices need cash flow models that account for the gap between case expenses and settlement recovery. Generic CFO advice does not address this.

**Case cost financing.** As cases grow in complexity, funding litigation costs becomes a strategic financial decision. A legal CFO evaluates case financing options and their impact on firm profitability.

**Tax strategy for law firms.** Your firm's structure (LLC, LLP, PC, or S-corp) affects how revenue flows to partners and how you optimize taxes. A CFO coordinates with your tax advisor to minimize the overall tax burden.

## When You Need a Fractional CFO

Consider a fractional CFO if any of these apply:

**Financial decisions feel like guesswork.** If you make hiring, spending, and pricing decisions based on instinct rather than data, a CFO brings the analysis that supports confident decisions.

**Cash flow is unpredictable.** If you worry about making payroll or get surprised by cash shortfalls, you need forecasting and collection management.

**You do not know which practice areas are profitable.** Revenue is not profit. If you cannot identify your most and least profitable work, you are likely subsidizing money-losing cases with profitable ones.

**You are planning growth or a sale.** Expansion, lateral hires, new offices, and eventual firm sale all require financial infrastructure that goes beyond basic bookkeeping.

**Partner compensation creates conflict.** If compensation discussions are contentious or feel arbitrary, objective financial modeling resolves disagreements with data.

## Documented Results

The data from fractional CFO engagements at law firms shows consistent patterns:

- **Months 1 to 3:** 15 to 25% cash flow improvement, 10 to 15 day collection cycle reduction, 3 to 5% operating expense cuts
- **Months 6 to 12:** 10 to 20% partner profitability gains, 20 to 30% working capital improvement, 85 to 95% forecast accuracy

One 25-attorney firm reduced overhead by 18% within six months. A 12-attorney firm increased profits by 18% in three months (GetExact, 2025; TL Turner Group, 2025).

The National Law Review reported in 2025 that mid-sized firms face rising costs and shrinking profits. Firms without dedicated financial leadership are the most vulnerable to these pressures. Fractional CFOs give smaller firms the same financial sophistication that large firms get from full-time hires.

## Three Mistakes That Cost Firms Money

**Using bookkeepers for strategic decisions.** Your bookkeeper is excellent at recording transactions. They are not trained to forecast cash flow, model profitability by practice area, or design partner compensation. These are different skill sets.

**Ignoring practice-area profitability.** Treating all revenue as equal leads to overinvesting in low-margin work. Break down profitability by practice area, case type, and attorney to see where money actually comes from and where it goes.

**Operating without dashboards.** Making pricing and hiring decisions without real-time financial visibility is like driving without a speedometer. Build KPI dashboards that track the numbers that matter: realization rate, collection rate, attorney utilization, and profit margin by practice area.

## How to Get Started

**Month 1: Diagnosis.** The CFO audits profitability by practice area, case type, and attorney. They identify aged receivables and collection risks. They assess your current financial reporting and identify gaps.

**Months 2 to 3: Build the infrastructure.** Implement cash flow forecasts. Build KPI dashboards. Renegotiate vendor contracts and banking relationships. Set up the systems that produce ongoing financial visibility.

**Months 4 and beyond: Ongoing strategy.** Scale the engagement based on results and growth trajectory. The CFO role can expand to cover M&A analysis, exit planning, and long-term [growth strategy](/services/fractional-cmo/) as the firm matures.

Target collections and overhead first. These areas typically show the fastest ROI. Firms often recover their fractional CFO costs within three to six months through improved collections alone.

## What This Means for Your Firm

Financial strategy is too important to leave to hope and instinct. A fractional CFO brings the financial leadership that drives profitability and growth at a price that works for firms with $5 million to $25 million in revenue.

The firms saving $249,000 to $459,000 annually while gaining 15 to 25% cash flow improvements understand the difference between bookkeeping and financial strategy. Your books are probably fine. Your financial strategy might not be.
