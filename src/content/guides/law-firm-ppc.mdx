## Introduction

I'm going to be blunt with you: Google Ads for law firms is expensive. Really expensive. But before you close this tab, hear me out—expensive doesn't necessarily mean bad. It just means you need to understand exactly what you're paying for and whether it makes financial sense for your practice.

Over the past decade, I've watched the legal services market transform. When I first started consulting with law firms on paid search, you could get a decent flow of leads for $20-30 per click in competitive markets. Today? That same click in a major metropolitan area for personal injury might cost you $100, $150, or even more. It's not uncommon for firms to spend $10,000-20,000 monthly just to test whether PPC even works for their practice area.

The uncomfortable truth is that many law firms burn through five, ten, sometimes twenty thousand dollars before they figure out whether Google Ads will actually work for them. And that's assuming they know what they're doing. If you don't have proper campaign structure, landing pages, and conversion tracking, that money might as well be thrown into a well.

But here's what keeps me coming back to recommend PPC despite these brutal realities: when it works, it works fast. Unlike SEO, which can take six months to two years to generate meaningful results, Google Ads can put qualified leads in your phone within 24 hours. For firms that have the cash flow to sustain it and the systems to convert it, paid search can be a game-changer.

This guide is my honest assessment of Google Ads for law firms—the good, the bad, the outrageously expensive, and the surprisingly profitable. I'll walk you through what you need to know before spending your first dollar, and I'll give you the real costs and conversion data from hundreds of campaigns I've managed or reviewed.

## How Law Firm PPC Works

Let me break down the mechanics of Google Ads, because understanding how the system actually works is crucial to understanding why it costs what it costs.

When someone searches "personal injury attorney near me" on Google, that search triggers an auction. Google's algorithm determines which law firms get to show ads for that search, and in what order. This happens in milliseconds. Your Google Ads account automatically bids on that keyword—either with a manual bid you've set or with an automated bidding strategy.

Here's the crucial part: you only pay when someone actually clicks your ad. Not for impressions, not for rankings, just for clicks. This is why it's called "pay-per-click" or PPC. If your ad shows 1,000 times but gets 10 clicks, you pay for those 10 clicks only.

The cost per click, or CPC, is determined by multiple factors working together. The first and most significant is competition. In any given market, multiple law firms might be bidding on the same keywords. The more firms bidding on a keyword, the higher the cost per click. Personal injury in a major city? Expect intense bidding. Estate planning in a rural area? Much cheaper.

The second factor is Quality Score. Google doesn't want to show bad ads that people ignore. So Google rewards advertisers who create relevant ads and landing pages with a lower cost per click. Quality Score ranges from 1 to 10, and the difference between a score of 4 and a score of 8 can literally cut your cost per click in half. Your Quality Score depends on click-through rate, landing page relevance, and account history.

The third factor is your maximum bid. This is the maximum amount you're willing to pay per click. Google's algorithm will generally spend less than your maximum bid if it can, but if you set your max bid at $50 and a competitor sets theirs at $75, you'll likely show in a lower position, or not at all.

Your ad rank is determined by your bid multiplied by your Quality Score. So a firm with a $50 bid and a Quality Score of 8 will often outrank a firm with a $100 bid but a Quality Score of 4. This is important because it means you can sometimes compete with bigger firms just by having better ads and landing pages.

From Keith: I've seen perfectly legitimate law firms get priced out of Google Ads because they tried to compete on bid alone without optimizing their Quality Score. I worked with one personal injury firm in Dallas that cut their cost per click by 40% in three months just by improving landing page relevance and rewriting their ad copy. They didn't change their bids at all. Quality Score matters.

Google has also introduced a concept called "smart bidding" which uses machine learning to automatically adjust your bids. Rather than manually setting a $50 max bid, you can tell Google your target CPA (cost per acquisition) is $400, and Google will automatically adjust bids to try to hit that target. This is powerful if you have clean conversion data, and dangerous if you don't.

The legal market has unique characteristics that impact PPC performance. Unlike e-commerce where someone might casually browse, legal services are high-intent searches. When someone searches "DUI attorney near me," they have a specific need. These searches convert at higher rates than typical searches, but they also attract more advertisers, which drives up costs.

Also relevant: many law firms get disqualified from showing certain ads due to Google's policies. If you practice family law, you might get flagged for ads on child custody keywords if your landing page isn't appropriately sensitive. If you do bankruptcy, Google wants to see certain disclosures. These policy restrictions mean fewer firms can bid on some legal keywords, which ironically can make some practice areas cheaper to bid on than others.

## The Cost Reality

Let me give you the actual numbers I'm seeing in the market right now. These are averages from the Google Ads accounts I've reviewed or managed in the past 12-24 months. Your specific costs will vary based on your market, competition level, and Quality Score.

| Practice Area | Avg CPC | Monthly Budget (Min) |
|---------------|---------|---------------------|
| Personal Injury | $50-$150+ | $5,000-$20,000 |
| Criminal Defense | $30-$80 | $3,000-$10,000 |
| Family Law | $20-$50 | $2,000-$8,000 |
| Immigration | $15-$40 | $1,500-$5,000 |
| Estate Planning | $15-$35 | $1,500-$4,000 |
| Bankruptcy | $25-$60 | $2,500-$8,000 |

These are realistic minimum budgets because Google Ads requires volume to optimize effectively. With less than 10-15 clicks per day, you can't gather enough data to know what's working and what isn't. You'll bounce around making changes that feel random because they basically are—you don't have enough information.

Personal injury is the most expensive because it's the most lucrative. A single personal injury case can generate $50,000, $100,000, or a million dollars in revenue. So firms can afford to pay more per click. I've seen personal injury attorneys in major markets paying $150-200+ per click, and they're doing it because the math works. One case pays for 500 clicks at that rate.

From Keith: I consulted with a personal injury firm in Los Angeles that was paying an average of $127 per click. That sounded insane until I looked at their conversion metrics. They were converting at 8%, meaning they got a lead for roughly $1,590. Their average case value was $45,000. Even accounting for overhead, that math works beautifully. Meanwhile, a bankruptcy firm in the same market was paying $55 per click but converting at 2%, making their cost per lead $2,750. They had to do more cases just to break even on ad spend.

Immigration and estate planning are on the cheaper end because the cases are less valuable. Immigration cases often generate $2,000-5,000 in fees. Estate planning $1,500-4,000. The lower potential revenue means lower bids, which means lower CPCs for everyone in that space.

Bankruptcy sits in the middle—cases are worth decent money ($5,000-15,000), but there's less competition in some markets, which keeps costs down.

Geographic factors matter enormously. A CPC that applies in New York or Los Angeles will be 50-70% higher than a similar market like Nashville or Austin. Smaller towns might be 50% cheaper than major metros. If you practice in a second or third-tier city, you're in a much better position cost-wise.

Here's a budget breakdown for what I'd actually recommend as a minimum to test Google Ads properly:

- Start with $3,000-5,000 monthly for low-competition practice areas (estate planning, immigration)
- Budget $5,000-10,000 monthly for moderate competition (family law, bankruptcy)
- Budget $10,000-20,000 monthly for high competition (personal injury)
- Allow for 60-90 days of testing before making final judgments

Why these timeframes? Because you need enough data. At 20 clicks per day (reasonable for a $5,000 monthly budget in immigration), you'll get 600 clicks in a month. That's enough to see some patterns, but not enough to be certain. By month three, you'll have 1,800 clicks and hopefully enough conversions to know whether this is working.

The biggest mistake firms make is spending $2,000 for 2-3 weeks, getting a couple of leads that don't convert, and declaring Google Ads "doesn't work." That's like testing a parachute by dropping it from five feet. You need actual height to know if it works.

## LSAs vs Google Ads

You've probably seen "Google Guaranteed" badges on the map section of Google search results. These are Local Services Ads, or LSAs, and they're a completely different beast from traditional Google Ads.

LSAs operate on a cost-per-lead model rather than cost-per-click. Google screens the attorney and verifies credentials. If someone books a call or sends a message through the LSA, you pay. If they just click and leave, you pay nothing.

On the surface, this sounds incredible. You only pay for actual leads, not clicks that lead nowhere. But let me give you the full picture:

| Factor | LSAs | Google Ads |
|--------|------|-----------|
| Pricing | Per lead | Per click |
| Placement | Top of page | Below LSAs |
| Trust factor | Google Screened | None |
| Control | Limited | Full |

LSA pricing typically ranges from $15-75 per lead depending on practice area and market. That sounds cheap compared to a $100 CPC, until you realize that many of those clicks would have happened for free if you were running regular Google Ads. Not every click becomes a lead. Some people click, read, and leave. So a $100 CPC that results in a 10% click-to-lead rate is actually a $1,000 cost per lead, which is obviously terrible. But a 40% click-to-lead rate on a $100 CPC is $250 per lead, which might be fine.

LSAs are legitimately excellent for high-volume, low-friction services. They work particularly well for:

- Criminal defense (high search volume, quick consultation calls)
- Bankruptcy (high search volume, routine intake calls)
- DUI/traffic (extremely high volume)

LSAs are less ideal for:

- Personal injury (cases need investigation time, not just quick calls)
- Complex family law (clients need detailed consultations, not quick calls)
- Estate planning (clients want to research before calling)

From Keith: I'm not anti-LSA. The firms I know running LSA campaigns exclusively in the criminal defense space are getting 3-5 times more leads per dollar than they would with traditional Google Ads. But these are high-volume, fast-moving practices. I worked with one criminal defense firm that got 40-50 LSA leads per month at $25 per lead, and converted 15-20% of those into retainers. Their cost per case was around $200-300. That's phenomenal. But I also know a family law firm that was getting LSA leads they couldn't handle because they required complex consultations and the leads were too quick and shallow. She switched to regular Google Ads and her conversion rate doubled because the leads were pre-qualified better.

Another consideration: Google controls your LSA appearance and messaging more than with regular Google Ads. You can't test as many variations. You get less data about what's actually working. And placement is at the top of search results, which sounds good, but Google decides whether to show your LSA or not based on their algorithm, not just your bid.

My recommendation: if you have high call volume, quick conversions, and you're in a practice area where people expect fast intake calls, LSAs are worth testing alongside or instead of traditional Google Ads. If your sales cycle is longer and more consultative, traditional Google Ads gives you better control and more testing flexibility.

Most successful law firms I know actually run both, allocating budget based on which channel performs better in their specific practice area.

## Is PPC Worth It? The Honest Answer

This is the question that matters. Everything else is just details. Is paying $50-150 per click, requiring $5,000-20,000 monthly budgets, actually worth it for your law firm?

The honest answer is: maybe. And that "maybe" depends on several specific factors about your firm.

First, your case value. If your average case generates $5,000 in fees, you have very little margin for error on PPC costs. If your average case generates $50,000, you have a lot of margin. This is the single biggest factor. A personal injury firm with $75,000 average case value is in a completely different financial situation than a family law firm with $4,000 average case value, even if they're both paying the same CPC.

Second, your conversion rate. This is your click-to-lead rate multiplied by your lead-to-client rate. So if 40% of ad clicks result in a lead form submission, and 25% of those leads become clients, your overall conversion rate is 10%. At a $50 CPC, that's $500 per client acquisition. At a $100 CPC, that's $1,000. At a $150 CPC, that's $1,500.

Here's a practical example: Let's say you're a family law attorney in a mid-size city. Your average case generates $6,000 in fees. A reasonable CPC for your area is $35. You need a conversion rate of 6% (click-to-client) just to break even on ad spend before overhead. That's actually quite high. Most family law firms I know convert at 2-3%, which means their cost per client is $1,200-1,750.

With a $6,000 case value, that's a net profit of $4,250-4,800 per case after ad spend. But that's before you account for the attorney time, support staff, office costs, software, etc. If your real profit margin is only 40%, you're looking at $1,700-2,000 in actual profit per case. PPC is now consuming 30-50% of your profit margin.

In this scenario, PPC might still work, but you need to be precise about it. You can't afford to be sloppy. You need excellent landing pages, tight conversion tracking, regular optimization, and probably an agency or specialist managing it.

Compare that to a personal injury firm with an average case value of $60,000. At a $100 CPC and a 6% conversion rate, your cost per client is $1,667. That's only 2.8% of your case value. Even with significant overhead, PPC is a small fraction of your profit. You have room to experiment, to test new keywords, to scale.

From Keith: I worked with a firm that had everything right except one thing: their landing pages. They were paying $80 CPC, converting at 2.5%, so cost per lead was around $3,200. I helped them redesign three landing pages specifically for personal injury cases in their area. Six weeks later, conversion rate was up to 4.2%, bringing their cost per lead down to $1,900. That single change added six-figures to their bottom line annually. This is why better execution matters so much in PPC.

The second question is: do you have the cash flow? I know that sounds obvious, but it matters more than people think. Even if the math says PPC should work out to a 3:1 ROAS (return on ad spend), you still have to spend $10,000 this month to make $30,000 in revenue. If you don't have cash reserves, this kills you. The money has to come in after you spend it, and there's often a lag between lead generation and case closure.

The third question is: do you have systems in place to measure results? You need:

- Google conversion tracking properly implemented on your website
- Call tracking (so you know which calls came from which ads)
- CRM integration (so you know which leads converted to clients)
- Monthly analysis of what's working and what's not

Without these systems, you can't actually tell if your PPC is working. You'll be guessing.

The fourth question is: can you commit to optimization? PPC isn't "set it and forget it." The accounts that perform well for me are the ones that get reviewed and adjusted at least monthly. New keywords are tested, underperforming keywords are paused, landing pages are updated based on what the data shows.

If you can answer "yes" to all of these questions, PPC is probably worth testing. If you can only answer "yes" to some of them, you might want to wait or start with a very small test budget.

## PPC vs SEO: Making the Right Choice

Every law firm that comes to me asks this question: should we do PPC or SEO?

The correct answer is almost always: both. But I understand that's not always realistic, so let me give you the real choice.

PPC is fast. If you start a Google Ads campaign today with $5,000, you can have leads coming in by next week. That's the beauty of paid search. The drawback is that it stops working the moment you stop paying.

SEO is slow. A realistic timeframe for meaningful results is 6-12 months for competitive keywords, longer for very competitive markets. But once you've ranked, traffic is relatively free. You pay for maintenance and updates, but you're not paying $100 per visitor.

From a financial perspective, here's how I think about it:

**Choose PPC if:**
- You need leads in the next 30-90 days
- You have sufficient case value that paid leads make sense
- You have cash flow to sustain a $3,000+ monthly ad spend
- You're in a highly competitive market where SEO would take 12-18 months

**Choose SEO if:**
- You can wait 6-12 months for results
- Your case value is lower ($5,000-15,000) where you need to optimize every dollar
- You want long-term sustainable traffic
- You're starting from zero online visibility

**Choose Both if:**
- You have the budget
- You want fast wins (PPC) while building long-term assets (SEO)
- You're in a competitive market where you need multiple visibility channels

Here's the financial comparison over 24 months:

PPC: $5,000/month × 24 months = $120,000 total spend. Zero residual value. When you stop paying, it stops.

SEO: $2,000/month × 24 months = $48,000 total spend. You now have ranked content generating leads, hopefully worth $500-2,000/month in value going forward for years.

The break-even point is typically around 18-24 months, at which point SEO becomes significantly cheaper per lead.

But here's the catch: SEO only works if you're in a market where it's possible. If you're a immigration attorney in a town of 50,000 people, you might rank position one for "immigration attorney [your city]" relatively easily. If you're a personal injury attorney in Los Angeles, you might never rank in the top three for "personal injury attorney Los Angeles" because the competition is too intense.

My recommendation: if you're starting from zero and you need leads now, start with PPC. It's faster and you'll learn valuable lessons about what people in your market are actually searching for. Use those insights to fuel your SEO strategy later.

## Managing PPC: DIY vs Agency

One of the biggest hidden costs of PPC is management. Someone has to monitor the account, adjust bids, pause underperforming keywords, test new variations, and optimize landing pages.

You have three options:

**1. Manage It Yourself**

This costs you time. If you're an attorney with a $400/hour billing rate, spending 10 hours per month on Google Ads is costing you $4,000/month in opportunity cost. That's just gone, even if the ads perform perfectly. And most attorneys, no matter how smart they are, don't optimize as well as someone who does this full-time.

I've reviewed hundreds of law firm Google Ads accounts that were being managed by the attorney themselves or someone in their office without PPC experience. The common problems:

- Keywords too broad ("attorney" instead of "personal injury attorney [city]")
- No conversion tracking, so they don't actually know what works
- Bids never adjusted, wasting money on underperforming keywords
- Ads not updated in years
- Landing pages that are generic firm pages instead of targeted pages

The upside: you save on agency fees.

**2. Hire an In-House PPC Manager**

This costs you salary, benefits, payroll taxes. A competent PPC specialist costs $50,000-75,000/year fully loaded. That's expensive, but if you're doing enough PPC volume to keep them busy (multiple accounts or very large accounts), it might be worth it.

The upside: dedicated attention on your business, deep knowledge of your firm, ability to coordinate with your sales and operations team.

The downside: fixed cost regardless of whether PPC is performing, requires hiring and managing another employee.

**3. Hire an Agency**

This typically costs 15-25% of your ad spend. So if you're spending $10,000/month, the agency costs $1,500-2,500/month. That seems expensive until you realize that even a small optimization (10-15% improvement in conversion rate) can pay for the agency fee and then some.

From Keith: I worked with a client who was managing their own $15,000/month law firm PPC budget. They brought me in to review the account. Within 30 days of optimization, their cost per lead dropped from $2,100 to $1,680—that's a 20% improvement. Their monthly spend was the same, but they were getting 20% more leads. Over a year, that's like getting $36,000 worth of free leads. The agency fee was $3,500/month. The math was obvious.

The upside of an agency: they focus on your account, they have tools and experience, they can often beat in-house performance because they work with multiple clients and see what works across industries.

The downside: less dedicated attention per account if the agency is stretched, potential conflict of interest if they're also managing competitors' accounts, less direct control.

My recommendation: if you're spending less than $5,000/month, manage it yourself or hire an agency. In-house doesn't make sense at that volume. If you're spending $5,000-15,000/month, an agency is probably your best bet. If you're spending more than $15,000/month and you're committed to PPC long-term, an in-house manager or dedicated agency relationship might make sense.

## PPC Best Practices

I could write 10,000 words on PPC best practices. Instead, here are the ones that actually move the needle for law firms:

**1. Separate Campaigns by Practice Area**

This is not optional. A single campaign for "criminal defense, bankruptcy, and family law" is a disaster. You'll get bad data, misallocated budget, and poor Quality Scores. Create separate campaigns for each major practice area and geographic area if you serve multiple regions.

**2. Create Targeted Landing Pages**

Your ads shouldn't go to your firm homepage. They should go to pages specifically about that practice area, in that location. "Personal Injury Attorney in Denver" should land on a page specifically about personal injury in Denver, not your homepage. This single change can double your conversion rate.

**3. Implement Proper Conversion Tracking**

Set up Google conversion tracking not just for form submissions, but for actual phone calls (using call tracking software). You need to know which ads generate actual phone calls, and ideally which calls convert to clients.

**4. Bid on Your Own Brand**

"[Your Firm Name] attorney" might seem like a waste, but it's not. Someone searching your firm name has high intent. The CPC is typically very low. And your competitors will bid on your brand if you don't.

**5. Use Ad Extensions**

Call extensions, sitelink extensions, location extensions—these all improve your ad's performance without increasing cost. They give users more reasons to click your ad instead of a competitor's.

**6. Write Benefit-Focused Ad Copy**

Instead of "Law firm specializing in bankruptcy," try "Stop wage garnishment in 30 days—free bankruptcy consultation." The second focuses on what the potential client gets, not what your firm does.

**7. Test Your Quality Score**

A Quality Score of 4 on a keyword might mean you're not getting impressions, or you're in position 8-10. If you have keywords with low Quality Scores, you have three options: improve them (better ads, better landing page), increase your bid to force visibility, or pause them. Don't just let them sit.

**8. Exclude Irrelevant Keywords**

Negative keywords are crucial. If you practice family law in Arizona, add "family law [competitor]" as a negative keyword so you don't show for their branded searches. Add "family law jobs" so you don't get applications. Add "family law degree" so you don't get students researching. This keeps your budget focused on actual potential clients.

---

## Getting Started

If you've read this far and you think Google Ads might make sense for your firm, here's what to do next.

**Step 1: Calculate Your Math**

Before you spend a penny, figure out:
- Your average case value
- Your target cost per case based on case value (usually 5-15% of case value)
- Your realistic conversion rate (if you don't know, assume 2-3%)
- Your minimum monthly budget based on your market

**Step 2: Set Up Conversion Tracking**

Before you launch a single ad, set up Google conversion tracking on your website and implement call tracking software. I recommend CallRail or Call Logic. You need to know what you're measuring before you start measuring it.

**Step 3: Create Your Campaign Structure**

Decide whether you'll run campaigns by practice area, by geography, or both. Plan out your account structure before you launch.

**Step 4: Write Targeted Landing Pages**

Don't drive ads to your homepage. Create 2-3 landing pages specific to your practice areas. They should address the specific concern of someone searching for that service in your area.

**Step 5: Start Small**

Launch with a test budget: $2,000-3,000 for the first month. Gather data. See what keywords work, what conversion rates you're actually getting. After 30 days of data, decide if you want to scale or pivot.

**Step 6: Optimize Monthly**

Once you're live, plan to spend 4-6 hours per month optimizing the account, or hire an agency to do it. Don't set it and forget it.

If you're ready to take this seriously, I'd recommend either working with an agency that specializes in law firm advertising, or getting certification through Google's academy (though certifications won't teach you law-specific strategy).

## FAQ

**Q: How long until Google Ads is profitable for my law firm?**

A: Minimum 60-90 days to gather enough data to know. Some firms see profitability within 30 days if they're optimizing well. Others need 6 months because they're learning as they go.

**Q: Can I outrank competitors without spending as much?**

A: Yes, through Quality Score. If your competitor is spending $100 per click but has a Quality Score of 4, and you're spending $50 with a Quality Score of 8, you'll often win visibility. Quality Score is determined by ad relevance, landing page quality, and account history.

**Q: How much do PPC agencies typically cost?**

A: 15-25% of ad spend is standard. Some charge flat fees ($1,000-5,000/month). Some do performance-based pricing (percentage of revenue generated). Compare options and make sure you understand what's included.

**Q: Is there seasonality in law firm PPC costs?**

A: Somewhat. Personal injury spikes after the holidays (more car accidents in winter). Tax season drives some bankruptcy searches. But honestly, law firm advertising is pretty consistent year-round because legal needs don't follow seasonal patterns like retail does.

**Q: What's the difference between Google Search Ads and Display Ads?**

A: Search Ads show when someone actively searches for something related to your keywords. Display Ads show on websites and apps as banner ads. For law firms, Search Ads almost always outperform Display Ads. Focus on Search first.

**Q: Should I use broad match or exact match for keywords?**

A: Start with exact or phrase match so you have tight control. Broad match can be efficient once you understand your conversion patterns, but it requires active negative keyword management. Most law firm PPC works better with tighter match types.

**Q: How do I know if my PPC agency is actually good?**

A: They should show you monthly reports with: clicks, impressions, click-through rate, cost per click, conversion rate, cost per conversion, and return on ad spend. If they're not showing you these metrics, ask why. They should also explain what they optimized each month and why.

**Q: Can I run Google Ads and LSAs simultaneously?**

A: Yes, and many law firms do. They sometimes compete for the same user, but they operate on different models (cost-per-click vs. cost-per-lead), so they can be complementary if you're testing what works best in your market.

## Real Results: What Law Firms Are Actually Seeing

Let me share a few real examples of PPC performance from firms I've worked with (names changed for privacy).

**Example 1: Personal Injury, Denver**

A firm spending $12,000/month on Google Ads. Average CPC: $87. Monthly clicks: ~138. Conversion rate: 4.3% (click to lead form). Cost per lead: $2,023. Case value: $58,000. Cost per lead as % of case value: 3.5%. ROI: Profitable after accounting for overhead.

**Example 2: Bankruptcy, Phoenix**

A firm spending $4,500/month on Google Ads. Average CPC: $35. Monthly clicks: ~129. Conversion rate: 5.1%. Cost per lead: $686. Case value: $8,500. Cost per lead as % of case value: 8.1%. ROI: Tight margin. They needed to either increase case value or improve conversion rate to be truly profitable. Solution: they combined PPC with LSAs, which gave them cheaper leads and better volume.

**Example 3: Immigration, Austin**

A firm spending $2,000/month on Google Ads. Average CPC: $18. Monthly clicks: ~111. Conversion rate: 3.2%. Cost per lead: $562. Case value: $3,500. Cost per lead as % of case value: 16%. ROI: This wasn't working. They pivoted to SEO and social media instead. PPC was too expensive for their business model.

The difference between these firms? Case value and conversion rate. The personal injury firm had both working in their favor. The bankruptcy firm was borderline. The immigration firm didn't have the unit economics to support PPC profitably.

From Keith: This is why I always start by looking at your fundamentals. Your case value and conversion rate determine whether PPC makes sense. I'd rather see a firm with a $15,000 case value and a 2% conversion rate skip PPC and invest in SEO, than see a firm with a $60,000 case value and a 3% conversion rate leave money on the table by not doing PPC. It's all about fit.

## Final Thoughts

Google Ads for law firms isn't a scam, but it's also not a miracle. It's a tool that works extremely well for some firms and poorly for others. The difference isn't luck—it's fundamentals.

If your case value is high, you have the cash flow to sustain advertising, and you're willing to optimize, Google Ads can generate more leads faster than any other channel. If those conditions aren't met, it might still work, but you need to be realistic about the ROI.

The biggest mistake firms make is underestimating the cost and overestimating their conversion ability. They think: "We'll just spend $2,000/month on Google Ads and it'll pay for itself." Maybe. But probably not without real management and optimization.

The second biggest mistake is expecting instant profitability. PPC is fast compared to SEO, but it still requires 60-90 days of data before you understand what's actually working. Plan for that time and budget.

If you're going to do this, do it right. Set up tracking, create targeted landing pages, commit to optimization, and give it real time and budget. Or don't do it at all. The middle ground—half-hearted attempts with minimal investment—is where money goes to die.

I'm an advocate for data-driven decision making. So before you decide whether PPC is right for your firm, calculate the actual numbers. What's your case value? What's a realistic conversion rate? What would you need to pay per click for this to be profitable? Then compare that to what Google Ads actually costs in your market.

If the math works, go for it. If it doesn't, there are other channels to explore.
