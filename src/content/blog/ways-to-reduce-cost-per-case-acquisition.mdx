# Ways to Reduce Cost per Case Acquisition

Your cost per case acquisition is the most important marketing metric you're probably not tracking.

It tells you exactly how much you spend in marketing to sign one new client. And for most law firms, it's higher than it needs to be.

Here's how to bring it down.

## Know Your Number First

You can't improve what you don't measure. Calculate your cost per case.

**Total marketing spend** ÷ **Number of new clients** = **Cost per case**

If you spent $20,000 last month and signed 10 clients, your cost per case is $2,000.

Now you have a baseline. Every improvement can be measured against it.

## The Two Ways to Reduce CPA

There are only two ways to lower your cost per case:

1. Spend less money to get the same clients
2. Get more clients for the same money

Most firms focus only on option one. They cut budgets and wonder why growth stalls.

The better approach is option two. Get more efficient, not just cheaper.

## Quick Wins

### Fix Your Intake Process

The fastest way to reduce cost per case is to convert more of the leads you're already getting.

If you convert 20% of leads to clients, and you improve to 30%, you just reduced your cost per case by 33%. Same marketing spend. More clients.

Intake improvements:

- Answer the phone faster (or at all)
- Respond to web leads within 5 minutes, not 5 hours
- Train staff on consultation conversion
- Follow up with leads who don't hire immediately
- Make scheduling easy

### Cut Underperforming Channels

Not all marketing channels perform equally. Some deliver great results. Some waste money.

Review each channel's cost per case. Double down on the winners. Cut the losers.

I've seen firms spending $5,000 per month on a channel that produced zero cases while another channel delivered clients at $500 each. The fix was obvious.

### Improve Landing Pages

If you're running PPC ads, your landing pages determine conversion rates.

Better landing pages mean more leads from the same ad spend. That directly reduces cost per case.

Improvements:

- Faster loading speed
- Clearer calls to action
- Stronger value proposition
- Social proof (reviews, results)
- Mobile optimization

### Negotiate with Vendors

When's the last time you reviewed your vendor contracts?

Agencies often give volume discounts. Long-term relationships sometimes mean better pricing. At minimum, understanding exactly what you're paying for prevents waste.

## Longer-Term Strategies

### Invest in SEO

PPC delivers immediate results but costs money for every click. SEO takes longer but delivers free traffic once you rank.

The math is compelling. A click that costs $150 on PPC costs $0 when you rank organically. Over time, SEO reduces your overall cost per case.

### Build Referral Systems

Referrals are typically your lowest-cost acquisition channel. Referred clients come pre-sold and cost nothing to acquire.

Systematize referrals:

- Ask satisfied clients for referrals
- Create referral programs
- Network with professionals who serve your clients
- Stay in touch with past clients

### Improve Client Lifetime Value

If clients refer others or come back for additional matters, their effective acquisition cost drops.

A client who costs $2,000 to acquire but refers two more clients has an effective cost of $667.

Focus on service quality, communication, and relationship building. Happy clients multiply your marketing efficiency.

### Specialize

Generalists compete with everyone. Specialists compete with few.

When you specialize in specific practice areas or client types, you can target marketing more precisely. Precise targeting means less waste and lower costs.

## What "Good" Looks Like

Cost per case varies dramatically by practice area.

Rough benchmarks:

- Personal injury: $500-2,000 (higher for big cases)
- Criminal defense: $300-800
- Family law: $300-700
- Estate planning: $200-500
- Business law: $500-1,500

Your mileage will vary based on market, competition, and case values. But these give you a sense of reasonable ranges.

## The Continuous Improvement Mindset

Cost per case reduction isn't a one-time project. It's an ongoing discipline.

Every month, review your numbers. Every quarter, evaluate your channels. Every year, reassess your strategy.

The firms that grow profitably treat acquisition cost like any other business metric. They measure it, track it, and constantly work to improve it.

## The Bottom Line

Reducing cost per case is about efficiency, not just cutting budgets. Fix your intake. Optimize your campaigns. Build referral systems. Track everything.

Small improvements compound. A 10% improvement in conversion plus a 10% improvement in channel efficiency plus a 10% increase in referrals adds up to dramatically lower acquisition costs.

That's how you build a profitable, growing practice.
