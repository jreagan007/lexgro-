Most workers' comp firms are still overspending on client acquisition.

Here's what changed in 2026: The firms cutting their cost per case to $2,500 aren't relying on referrals alone anymore. They're combining targeted digital channels with traditional networks—and it's working.

Workers' comp keywords cost $100-$200 per click (versus $1,000+ for catastrophic injury cases). That's your competitive advantage. The question is: are you capturing those searches?

The firms dominating right now understand something simple: injured workers search online before they call. If you're not visible when they do, you're losing cases to competitors who are.

What's your biggest bottleneck in client acquisition right now?
