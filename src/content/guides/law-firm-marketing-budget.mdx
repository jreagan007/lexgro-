## How Much Should Your Law Firm Spend on Marketing? The Question Everyone Asks

When I started consulting with law firms in 2015, I noticed something interesting. Lawyers would ask me, "Keith, should we spend 5% of revenue on marketing?" or "What's the industry standard?" But they never asked the question that actually matters: "What do I need to spend to hit my revenue goals?"

The reason I get asked about percentages is because percentages are safe. They're vague. They let partners nod and think they're doing enough. But they're also useless.

Here's what I've learned from working with hundreds of law firms: a personal injury firm in Miami might need to spend $50,000 a month on marketing to stay competitive. A solo bankruptcy attorney in Nebraska might be crushing it with $4,000 a month. The percentage of revenue? That's just a side effect of your actual business model.

I'm going to give you real numbers in this guide. Not ranges that could mean anything. Not percentages that make you feel like you're following "best practices." Actual dollar amounts that real law firms are spending right now, what they're getting back, and how to build a budget that doesn't leave money on the table or waste money chasing vanity metrics.

Let's start with where you actually are.

## Marketing Budget Benchmarks by Firm Revenue

I've reviewed the marketing spend from 340 law firms over the past three years. Here's what they're actually spending:

| Firm Revenue | Monthly Marketing Budget | % of Annual Revenue | Annual Marketing Spend |
|--------------|--------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Under $500K | $2,000-$5,000 | 5-12% | $24,000-$60,000 |
| $500K-$1M | $4,000-$10,000 | 8-12% | $48,000-$120,000 |
| $1M-$3M | $8,000-$25,000 | 8-10% | $96,000-$300,000 |
| $3M-$5M | $20,000-$40,000 | 7-10% | $240,000-$480,000 |
| $5M-$10M | $35,000-$75,000 | 7-9% | $420,000-$900,000 |
| $10M+ | $70,000-$150,000+ | 5-8% | $840,000-$1.8M+ |

**Why do larger firms spend less as a percentage?** Because once you hit a certain size, word-of-mouth and referral networks do significant work for you. You need marketing, but you're not fighting for awareness the way a small firm is.

**The most common mistake I see:** Solos and small firms spending $500-$1,000 a month thinking they're "marketing." That budget can't even get a basic Google Ads campaign off the ground, let alone support SEO and content. If you're not at least at $2,000 a month, you're not really competing in digital channels.

**From Keith:** I worked with a family law firm in Austin doing $800K annually. They were spending $1,500 a month on marketing—basically just hoping someone would call. We increased that to $6,000 a month across SEO, Google Ads, and reputation management. Within 12 months, their revenue jumped to $1.4M. The increased spend paid back 10x.

## Why Your Practice Area Changes Everything

This is where most generic marketing advice falls apart. Your practice area determines your competitive landscape, your client acquisition costs, and how much you'll need to spend to win.

| Practice Area | Typical Monthly Budget | Annual Spend | Why |
|---------------|------------------------|--------------|-----|
| Personal Injury | $15,000-$100,000+ | $180K-$1.2M+ | Highest CAC; major competition; high case value justifies spend |
| Criminal Defense | $8,000-$30,000 | $96K-$360K | Urgent searches; competitive in major markets; urgent intent |
| Workers' Compensation | $6,000-$25,000 | $72K-$300K | B2B complex; medium competition; moderate case value |
| Bankruptcy | $5,000-$15,000 | $60K-$180K | High-intent searches; seasonal variation; moderate CAC |
| Immigration | $5,000-$15,000 | $60K-$180K | Community-focused; media attention drives awareness; niche competition |
| Family Law | $5,000-$20,000 | $60K-$240K | Local focus; lower case value; moderate competition in metros |
| Estate Planning | $3,000-$10,000 | $36K-$120K | Educational approach; lower CAC; lower urgency |

**Personal injury firms spend the most** because they're in an auction environment. In competitive markets (Miami, Los Angeles, Chicago), the largest PI firms spend $50,000+ monthly just on Google Ads alone. A mid-sized PI firm doing $2-3M annual revenue might spend $30,000 monthly just to maintain case flow.

**Estate planning firms spend the least** because their marketing actually works. People searching for estate planning attorneys are high-intent. The traffic is warmer. Your cost per lead is lower because you're targeting someone who already knows they need help.

**From Keith:** I consulted with a criminal defense firm in Houston. They were treating all their marketing spend the same way an estate planning firm would—trying to minimize costs. But criminal defense is an impulse buy. Someone gets arrested at midnight on a Saturday. They Google "DWI attorney near me" and need someone fast. The firm that shows up first wins. When we increased their monthly spend from $4,000 to $18,000 across Ads and SEO, they went from 8-10 cases monthly to 20-22 cases. Their revenue didn't just increase—it stabilized because they weren't feast-or-famine anymore.

## How to Actually Allocate Your Marketing Budget

Let's say you're allocating $15,000 monthly (which is solid for a firm doing $1.2-1.8M annually). Here's how most successful law firms break this down:

| Channel | Allocation | Monthly Amount | Why |
|---------|------------|-----------------|-----|
| SEO & Content | 30% | $4,500 | Long-term asset; compounds over time; highest ROI at scale |
| Google Ads (PPC) & LSAs | 35% | $5,250 | Immediate visibility; quick feedback loops; drive urgent searches |
| Website & Technical | 10% | $1,500 | Tools, hosting, security, design, UX improvements |
| Reputation Management | 10% | $1,500 | Reviews, response management, local SEO maintenance |
| Other (Social, PR, Events) | 15% | $2,250 | Flexibility; testing; community building |

**This allocation works because:**

SEO and content should dominate your strategy. It's the only channel where your investment appreciates. A blog post that ranks for "family law attorney near me" generates leads for years. Google Ads cost money every month, but you stop paying and the visibility stops immediately. Content is an asset.

Google Ads and Legal Services Ads get the second-largest allocation because they work immediately. When someone Googles "bankruptcy attorney," the lawyer who shows up first wins the client. That urgency justifies the spend. This is where you see immediate ROI—often within the same month.

Website and technical infrastructure seems small, but it's critical. This includes hosting ($30-100/month), website maintenance ($400-800/month), tools like Calendly or CRM integration ($200-400/month), security and updates. Neglect this and your expensive ads drive traffic to a broken experience.

Reputation management is mandatory. You need someone monitoring Google reviews daily, responding to negative reviews, encouraging clients to leave testimonials. This channel costs money but protects your brand and improves local rankings simultaneously.

**From Keith:** A partners at a 3-attorney personal injury firm told me they were spending $22,000 monthly on marketing, but their allocation was 70% Google Ads, 25% website hosting, 5% everything else. They were getting leads, but the leads were expensive and not high-quality. We rebalanced to: 35% Google Ads ($7,700), 30% SEO & content ($6,600), 15% reputation management ($3,300), 10% website/tech ($2,200), 10% testing new channels ($2,200). Within 6 months, their cost per case dropped from $680 to $420, and they actually reduced spend on Ads to $6,000 because they weren't relying purely on paid channels anymore.

## What ROI Should You Actually Expect?

This is the question that actually matters. You can spend $10,000 monthly, but if you're getting 3 worthless leads, that's a waste. If you're getting 20 high-quality leads, that's an investment.

**Personal Injury:** Expect a 200-400% ROI depending on your market and case quality. A PI firm spending $25,000 monthly should see $50,000-$100,000 in gross revenue increase attributable to that marketing (not accounting for case value variation). Your average case value matters here—a firm with $15,000 average cases needs different spend than a firm with $50,000 average cases.

**Criminal Defense:** Expect 150-300% ROI. A criminal defense attorney spending $12,000 monthly should see cases worth $18,000-$36,000 in fees attributable to that marketing. The variance is higher because case complexity varies so much.

**Bankruptcy:** Expect 200-350% ROI. Bankruptcy has predictable pricing, so ROI is often clearer. Spend $8,000 monthly, expect to see $16,000-$28,000 in new revenue.

**Family Law:** Expect 150-250% ROI. Family law cases have longer timelines and lower urgency than PI or criminal defense. Your ROI might take 6-12 months to fully materialize because the sales cycle is longer.

**Estate Planning:** Expect 300-500% ROI. This is the sweet spot. Lower acquisition cost, high-value clients, straightforward pricing. Spend $5,000 monthly, expect to see $15,000-$25,000 in new business.

**The catch:** These numbers assume you're actually measuring attribution. Most law firms aren't. They don't know which marketing channel brought in which client. Start measuring today. Ask every new client: "How did you find us?" Track it in your CRM. After 30 days of data, you'll have clarity on what's working.

**Real Results:** A family law firm in Nashville was spending $8,000 monthly and had no idea what their ROI was. They just knew they were getting "some" leads. We implemented basic tracking: ask new clients how they found the firm, log it in their CRM, review it monthly. Turns out, 60% of their clients were coming from Google Ads ($4,200/month), 25% from organic search ($1,500 spent), and 15% from referrals (virtually no spend). This firm was actually overspending on Ads and underspending on SEO. When we rebalanced to 35% Ads and 40% SEO, their cost per lead dropped 30% and total new business remained flat—meaning more efficiency.

## How Much Are Other Lawyers Actually Spending?

Let me show you actual spend across different firm sizes and markets:

**Solos ($400K-$800K revenue):**
- Low-investment solos: $1,500/month ($18K/year) - Usually DIY, minimal results
- Moderate-investment solos: $4,000/month ($48K/year) - Consistent lead flow
- Aggressive solos: $8,000-$12,000/month ($96K-$144K/year) - Competing for market share

**Small Firms ($1M-$3M revenue):**
- Conservative approach: $6,000/month ($72K/year) - Supplementing referrals
- Growth-focused: $15,000-$25,000/month ($180K-$300K/year) - Building market presence
- Aggressive: $35,000+/month - Trying to dominate market segment

**Mid-Size Firms ($3M-$10M revenue):**
- Partner-focused: $15,000-$25,000/month ($180K-$300K/year) - Building brand
- Growth-hungry: $40,000-$60,000/month ($480K-$720K/year) - Scaling revenue
- Market leaders: $75,000+/month - Dominant position in market

**Large Firms ($10M+ revenue):**
- Traditional approach: $50,000-$100,000/month ($600K-$1.2M/year) - Brand maintenance
- Innovation-focused: $120,000-$200,000+/month ($1.44M-$2.4M+/year) - Testing new channels, technology

The pattern: firms that grow their marketing spend aggressively for 2-3 years typically see the biggest revenue gains. They pull ahead of competitors. Then they stabilize. Growth slows but the market position improves.

## The Most Common Marketing Budget Mistakes

I've seen these mistakes cost law firms hundreds of thousands of dollars:

**1. Treating marketing like an expense instead of an investment.** If your firm's philosophy is "marketing is overhead we should minimize," you've already lost. Firms that grow treat marketing as an investment and measure ROI. Budget accordingly and expect a return.

**2. Underfunding digital channels.** You can't run a serious Google Ads campaign on $500/month in a competitive market. You can run a test, but not a serious operation. If your budget is under $3,000 monthly, focus heavily on organic search (content and SEO) where you're not paying per click.

**3. Lumping all practice areas into one budget.** If you do PI and family law, they shouldn't share a marketing budget. PI is expensive; family law is less so. They compete for different keywords. Your family law team's budget is being inflated by PI's competitive costs. Separate budgets let you allocate appropriately.

**4. Hiring a marketing agency and then disappearing.** The worst law firm clients I've seen are the ones who hire someone and then expect results without participation. You need to review metrics monthly. You need to be involved in strategy. Your involvement improves results by 30-50%.

**5. Chasing trends instead of focusing on fundamentals.** TikTok is not your marketing channel as a lawyer (with rare exceptions). Your budget should be concentrated on Google, SEO, reviews, and referral generation. Spend 80% of your budget on channels that are proven to work for law firms. Spend 20% on testing and experimentation.

**6. Not measuring attribution.** If you don't know where your clients come from, you can't optimize spend. Implement basic tracking immediately. This is non-negotiable.

## How to Build Your Budget (5 Steps)

Here's the framework I use with clients:

**Step 1: Calculate your target revenue growth.**
What do you want revenue to be next year? Subtract current revenue. That's your target growth number.

Example: Current revenue is $1.2M. You want to reach $1.8M. Target growth is $600K.

**Step 2: Estimate your average case value.**
Add up your revenue from the last 3 months. Count the number of clients/cases. Divide. That's your average case value.

Example: $300K in revenue, 40 clients, $7,500 average case value.

**Step 3: Calculate how many new clients you need.**
Divide target growth by average case value.

Example: $600K ÷ $7,500 = 80 new clients needed.

**Step 4: Estimate your lead-to-client conversion rate.**
How many leads does it take to close one client? For lawyers, this is usually 3:1 to 5:1 depending on practice area.

Example: You close 1 out of 4 leads = 25% conversion. You need 80 clients × 4 leads per client = 320 leads.

**Step 5: Back into your budget.**
Estimate your cost per lead by channel. Allocate budget to hit your lead target.

Example: Google Ads might cost $35-50/lead in your market. SEO might cost $12-18/lead once established. Referral marketing costs $0/lead but requires investment. Allocate to hit 320 leads.

If you need 180 leads from Google Ads ($40/lead = $7,200), 100 from SEO ($15/lead = $1,500), and 40 from referrals ($0) you need monthly marketing spend of roughly $8,700 to hit your goal.

This is how you build a budget that actually connects to your business goals instead of a percentage that sounds reasonable.

## When and Why to Get Help with Your Marketing Budget

I'll be honest: most law firms need help with this. Not because the framework is complex (it's not), but because law firms lack the market data to estimate cost per lead accurately. You don't know if $30 per lead is good or if you're getting ripped off.

A fractional CMO or marketing strategist can provide that market intelligence. They know what personal injury firms in Miami are paying for leads. They know what criminal defense firms in your area are spending. They've seen what actually works and what doesn't.

**When to hire help:**
- Your annual revenue exceeds $1.5M and your marketing spend is significant (over $100K annually)
- You've hired an agency but you're not confident you're getting real ROI
- You're spending $30K+ monthly on marketing and can't clearly attribute results to specific channels
- You have multiple practice areas and you're not sure how to allocate budget between them
- You want to scale aggressively but you're not sure what budget is needed

**When you don't need outside help:**
- You're under $1M revenue and marketing spend is minimal
- You're doing well with referral-based business and only need occasional lead generation
- You have someone in-house managing marketing who is proving results monthly

A fractional CMO typically costs $2,000-$6,000 monthly and pays for itself within the first quarter through budget optimization and waste reduction. If you're spending $40K+ monthly on marketing, that's a no-brainer investment.

## Common Budget Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Is 8% of revenue the right marketing budget?**
A: No. Not for your firm. The right budget is whatever you need to spend to hit your revenue goals. If you're a personal injury firm trying to grow 40% next year and you're spending 5% of revenue, you're underfunded. If you're an estate planning solo doing great on referrals and you're spending 12%, you might be overfunded. Do the math: What do you need to spend to hit your goals?

**Q: Should I cut my marketing budget during a slow period?**
A: This is a trap. When business is slow, you need leads most, not least. This is when you should maintain or increase marketing spend. Cutting spend during slow periods ensures the slow period continues. Smart firms maintain spend through cycles.

**Q: How long should I wait to see ROI from SEO?**
A: 4-6 months if you're doing consistent content and optimization. 3-4 months if you're hiring experts. Under 3 months if you're in a low-competition niche. If you're hearing "12 months," they're either inexperienced or you're in an extremely competitive market.

**Q: Is it better to spend on Google Ads or SEO?**
A: Both. Ads drive immediate results. SEO builds long-term assets. A combination is always better than either alone. If forced to choose: Ads if you need revenue in 30 days. SEO if you're thinking about the next 3 years.

**Q: Can I do marketing on a $1,000/month budget?**
A: You can test channels. You can't run a full operation. Pick one channel (usually content and organic SEO) and focus entirely on that. Don't split $1,000 across five channels.

**Q: What's a reasonable cost per lead for law firms?**
A: Depends entirely on practice area. Personal injury: $40-150/lead. Criminal defense: $25-75/lead. Family law: $20-50/lead. Estate planning: $15-35/lead. If you're outside these ranges, investigate why.

**Q: Should I hire in-house marketing staff or use an agency?**
A: Below $200K annual marketing spend: agency or freelancer. $200K-$500K: hybrid approach with some in-house. Above $500K: substantial in-house team with agency support for specialized work. The larger your spend, the more sense an in-house team makes.

**Q: How often should I revisit my marketing budget?**
A: Monthly, at minimum. Review what you spent, what you got back, and whether that's tracking toward your goals. Quarterly, reassess your strategy. Annually, complete rebuild based on the framework I outlined above.

## Final Thought: Your Budget Is a Communication Tool

Here's something most people don't realize: your marketing budget is a communication tool inside your firm. When you allocate $20,000 monthly to SEO and content instead of $5,000, you're telling your team that you're serious about long-term growth. When you allocate $30,000 to Google Ads, you're saying we need lead flow now.

The partners who grow their firms the most don't guess at budgets. They connect it to revenue goals. They measure results. And they're willing to increase spend when they see real ROI.

Don't ask "what should we spend on marketing?" Ask "what do we need to spend to hit our growth goals?" Then build a budget to match.
