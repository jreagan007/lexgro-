Most law firms are flying blind on marketing spend.

They allocate 2-20% of revenue without knowing if it's working. The firms pulling ahead in 2026? They track three numbers obsessively: cost per lead, cost per signed case, and lifetime client value.

Here's what the data shows: Small firms in steady markets spend 7-10% of revenue on marketing. Metro firms chasing growth? 12-15%. Those in cutthroat markets? 15-20%+. But raw percentage means nothing without ROI metrics attached.

The real insight: 52% of firms are holding budgets flat despite rising costs—Google Ads are up 15% year-over-year. Meanwhile, the winners are shifting allocation. They're building long-term foundations (SEO and content at 40-50% of budget) while cutting waste in volatile paid channels. They're also setting aside 10% specifically for testing new tactics.

What's your firm's biggest marketing blind spot right now?

2026 law firm marketing truth: Your % of revenue matters less than tracking cost per lead, cost per case, and LTV. Winners allocate 40-50% to SEO/content, rest to paid. Data beats guessing. #LawFirmMarketing #MarketingROI
