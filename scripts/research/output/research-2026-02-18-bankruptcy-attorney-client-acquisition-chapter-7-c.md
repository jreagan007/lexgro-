#### The Bankruptcy Market Reality: Fewer Filings, Tighter Competition
- U.S. bankruptcy attorney market fell to $6.1B in 2025, down 4.3% CAGR since 2020, as consumer Chapter 7/13 filings declined with stabilizing debt levels.
- Chapter 11 filings hit a 10-year high in 2025, signaling corporate stress that may indirectly boost consumer demand if economic conditions worsen.
- Despite market contraction, firms spending 7-10% of revenue on marketing (vs. industry average 2-5%) generate 33% more leads.

#### Where Chapter 7 and 13 Clients Actually Start: Search-First Behavior
- 96% of people seeking legal advice start with search engines—not referrals—making SEO critical for bankruptcy visibility.
- Top firms allocate 75% of search budgets to SEO and 25% to PPC, yet PPC carries a 43.9% bounce rate and 97% of users cite cost concerns.
- Legal ad spend surged 39% from 2020-2024 despite fewer ads, driving PPC costs up 84% while volume fell 50%.

#### The 16-Day Timeline: Why Response Speed Separates Winners From Losers
- Bankruptcy leads convert in 16 days average—tied as slowest in legal services—compared to personal injury at 3 days.
- 67% of prospects decide based on response speed; AI intake tools delivering <30-second responses boost conversions by 40%.
- MyCase data: Online forms convert at 17.6% (10,286 clients from 58,395 leads in 2023), vs. 7% nationwide new-call-to-case rate.

#### Lead Sources That Actually Work: Phone, Organic Search, Local Services Ads
- 61% of inbound leads arrive via phone calls; 11% of firms rank Local Services Ads as their second-best lead source.
- Organic search and LSAs combine for consistent high-intent traffic, while PPC increasingly filters out low-commitment shoppers.
- Chapter 7 and 13 keyword targeting requires differentiated messaging: liquidation vs. repayment plans.

#### The Conversion Stack: AI Intake, Online Forms, E-Signature, Email Nurture
- 93% of mid-sized firms adopted AI for intake; e-signature and online forms boost revenue 20% and conversions 12%.
- Firms blending automated intake, content marketing, and email nurture outpace pure PPC-dependent competitors.
- Email reach expands to 4.73B users by 2026—critical for nurturing slow bankruptcy leads during the 16-day cycle.

#### Budget Reality Check: What High-Growth Firms Spend vs. What You're Spending
- 69% of small firms (<25 employees) and 79% of larger firms plan marketing increases in 2025-2026.
- High-growth bankruptcy practices allocate 7-10% of revenue to marketing; underspending at 2-5% forfeits 33% in lead volume.
- 69-79% of budget reallocation targets SEO and LSAs over declining-efficiency PPC channels.

#### 2026 Headwinds and Opportunities: Economic Signals to Watch
- If Chapter 11 trends spread to consumer debt in 2026, filings may spike—prepare intake systems to scale.
- Market CAGR projects continued decline through 2030 unless recession accelerates filings; diversify messaging to capture both liquidation and reorganization clients.
- Radio and outdoor ads grew 261% and 260% since 2017, despite digital dominance—hybrid channels reach cost-sensitive bankruptcy prospects offline.

#### The Execution Roadmap: Seven Actions for Q1 2026
- Allocate 75% of search budget to Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 keyword campaigns; test 25% to PPC/LSAs for high-intent funneling.
- Implement AI intake with <30-second response targets and online forms; measure against MyCase benchmark of 17.6% conversion.
- Increase total marketing spend to 7-10% of revenue; backfill SEO efficiency gains with local radio or direct mail to offset market shrinkage.
- Map the 16-day bankruptcy cycle: prioritize fast closers via phone follow-up (61% of leads), e-sign completion, and email nurture sequences.
- Audit PPC performance; reallocate 50% of underperforming PPC spend to LSA optimization and organic content targeting Chapter 7 vs. 13 decision trees.
- Build chapter-specific landing pages and content hubs; differentiate messaging between asset liquidation and income-based repayment plans.
- Monitor 2026 filing data monthly; prepare to scale intake if Chapter 11 corporate stress bleeds into consumer filings by Q2.

Bankruptcy filings are down, but that doesn't mean your firm can't win more clients.

The market contracted 4.3% over five years, and 2025 saw another dip. But here's what separates thriving firms from struggling ones: they're not chasing a shrinking pie—they're capturing a bigger slice.

Top bankruptcy practices invest 7-10% of revenue in marketing (vs. the industry average of 2-5%) and generate 33% more leads as a result. They prioritize speed: 67% of clients decide based on response time, and firms using AI for sub-30-second responses see 40% conversion lifts.

The real opportunity? Most bankruptcy prospects start their search online (96%), but they're not finding you. SEO and PPC dominate top firm budgets because they work—organic search and Local Services Ads consistently deliver qualified leads.

Your conversion funnel matters more than market size right now.

What's your biggest bottleneck: getting leads in the door or converting them?
