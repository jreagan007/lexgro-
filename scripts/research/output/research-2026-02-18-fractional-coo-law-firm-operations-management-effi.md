## Key Facts & Statistics

- Average law firm profit growth reached **13.0%** in 2025, with midsize firms achieving nearly **5% demand growth** in the second half of the year, outpacing Am Law 100 firms at **2%**.[5][8]
- **54%** of legal professionals used AI for drafting correspondence in 2025, while **14%** applied it to analyze firm data and matters, highlighting automation's role in efficiency.[6]
- Top executive salaries exceed **$1 million** annually, making full-time BigLaw-level COOs unaffordable for most midsize firms (75-400 lawyers), driving fractional models.[1]
- By 2026, a third (**33%**) of UK lawyers could work as legal consultants, signaling a broader shift toward fractional expertise in legal operations.[4]
- Midsize firms around **30 attorneys** require enterprise-level financial sophistication, often lacking it without fractional support.[2]
- **Fractional executives as a best practice**: Midsize law firms (75-400 lawyers) are increasingly adopting fractional COOs, CFOs, and CHROs for operations management, mirroring proven models in tech, finance, and private equity; this provides BigLaw talent at part-time costs to handle AI, cybersecurity, compliance, and profitability.[1][2]
- **Profit squeeze and operational divergence**: Strong 2025 demand contrasts with uneven results, as firms above ~150 lawyers invest in tech/data infrastructure and business-side owners (e.g., Chief Practice Officers) for AI pilots and repeatable workflows in drafting, diligence, and pricing, while smaller ones lag.[3][8]
- **Automation and AI integration**: Rising client expectations for sophisticated systems push firms toward AI for workflows (e.g., matter management, error reduction), with a shift from lawyer committees to dedicated operational leaders.[3][6]
- **Scaling redefinition**: The "midsize" category has inflated, with 150-400 lawyer firms building scale-like sophistication without BigLaw bureaucracy, fueled by fractional leadership for 2025-2026 resilience.[3][1]
- Engage a fractional COO at **50% capacity** to prioritize WIP/AR management, collections acceleration, and pricing strategy, directly boosting profit per equity partner without full-time salaries over $1M.[1][2]

Your lawyers are amazing at law. Your operations? Maybe not so much.

Here's the thing: midsize firms grew 5% in demand last year, but many are still running on systems built for a 50-person shop. The result? Profit margins get squeezed, collections drag, and your best people leave because they're burned out managing chaos.

A fractional COO isn't another person to manage. They're an experienced operations leader (think BigLaw-caliber) who works part-time to fix what's broken: automate workflows, optimize WIP and AR, implement real systems, and build a scalable infrastructure.

Firms that made this move saw 13% profit growth in 2025. Not from working harder. From working smarter.

Your firm has the clients. You have the talent. What you need is someone who can unlock the operational efficiency hiding inside your practice.
