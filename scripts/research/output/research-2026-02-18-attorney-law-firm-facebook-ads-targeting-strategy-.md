Lead Generation

### Sections

#### Why Lead Generation Campaigns Outperform Every Other Objective
- Lead gen campaigns deliver 2.53% CTR—61% higher than traffic or engagement campaigns[1]
- Native lead forms keep prospects in Facebook ecosystem, reducing friction[1]
- Meta's Andromeda algorithm now identifies hidden intent signals, not just explicit searches[3]
- Legal services rank average at 1.61% CTR overall—lead gen objective fixes this gap[1]

#### Build Three Custom Audiences That Actually Convert
- Website visitors who didn't convert: Retarget landing page visitors excluding those who hit Thank You page[2]
- Lookalike audiences from past clients: Let algorithm find prospects with identical characteristics to your best conversions[2]
- Practice-area specific segments: Family law gets parents 30-55; estate planning targets 55+ with wealth signals; personal injury uses accident-related search behavior[2]
- Broaden targeting more than you think: Overly restrictive audiences miss 33% of high-intent prospects the algorithm could find[3]

#### The Mobile-First Creative Requirement (Non-Negotiable)
- 94-98% of traffic comes from mobile—desktop-focused creative is costing you leads[1]
- Mobile CTRs run 33-52% higher than desktop when optimized for thumb-scroll stopping power[1]
- Instagram Stories: 1.34% CTR (highest performer); Facebook Feed: 1.11% CTR; Reels: 0.94% but 10-30% cheaper CPM[1]
- Video must be vertical (9:16 aspect ratio), 15-60 seconds, with bold text overlays and pattern interrupts[3]

#### Budget Allocation: Where Your Money Actually Works
- 60% Facebook / 40% Instagram standard split—but test by practice area[2]
- 40-50% of budget to Reels despite lower CTR: CPM advantage + growing platform momentum[1][2]
- 30% to Instagram Stories: Highest engagement quality for legal services[1]
- 20-30% to Feed placements: Stable volume, proven conversion for consultation booking

#### Retargeting Sequences That Close Cases
- Website visitors with 14-day retargeting window before they forget about you[2]
- Lead form submitters get 7-day follow-up: Offer consultation booking incentive or address common objections[2]
- Consultation no-shows: 3-day retargeting with 'Let's reschedule' messaging[2]
- Past clients: Cross-sell additional services (family law client → estate planning)

#### How to Use Lookalike Audiences Without Killing Performance
- Start with your conversion pixel data (not lead form submissions) to build lookalikes[2]
- Upload past client email lists to create similar audiences—highest-quality starting data[2]
- Let Andromeda's deep learning match creative to buyer journey stage automatically[3]
- Avoid over-segmentation: Broader audiences with algorithm optimization beat narrow targeting in 2026[3]

#### Creative Formats That Work (And Which Ones Drain Budget)
- Video ads: Explain complex legal concepts; introduce firm personality and attorney expertise[1]
- Lead generation ads: Capture contact info directly on Facebook without landing page friction[1]
- Carousel ads: Highlight multiple practice areas or attorney profiles[1]
- Single image ads: Use sparingly—lowest CTR; works for brand awareness only, not lead gen[1]

#### The Numbers: Why Your Competitors Are Stealing Your Cases
- 28% of legal marketers rank Facebook Ads as top paid social platform, but most don't optimize for lead gen objective[1]
- 62% of law firms use Facebook; only 33% use it daily—inconsistent content = wasted retargeting budget[1]
- Facebook reaches 77.9% of social media users in Australia across every adult demographic—no other platform matches this[3]
- Average session time: 3 minutes 42 seconds—longer than LinkedIn, plenty of time for brand messaging before lead capture[2]

#### Setup Checklist: Launch Your First Lead Gen Campaign in 24 Hours
- Define your niche: One practice area per campaign (family law, personal injury, estate planning, criminal defense)[1]
- Target by demographics: Age, location, income level, education—use Facebook's detailed options[1]
- Build three custom audiences: Website visitors, lookalikes, practice-area specific segments[2]
- Create one mobile-first video (vertical, 30-45 seconds, problem-solution format)[1]
- Set lead gen objective, allocate budget, enable Advantage+ placements to let algorithm optimize[3]
- Measure by cost per lead, not CTR—legal services require different success metrics[1]

## Social Media Posts

### LinkedIn
```
Most law firms are leaving money on the table with Facebook ads.

You're targeting too broad. Your creative isn't optimized. And you're not retargeting the right people at the right time.

Here's what actually works in 2026: Facebook Ads deliver 29% ROI for law firms—the highest-performing social channel in legal services. But only if you get three things right.

First, stop casting a wide net. Use custom audiences to retarget past website visitors and custom lookalike audiences to find similar prospects. Second, go video-first. Meta's algorithm now identifies intent through creative quality, not just demographics. Third, structure campaigns strategically: 60% brand awareness to build reach, then layer in lead generation campaigns to convert engaged prospects.

The firms winning right now aren't doing anything fancy. They're being methodical.

What's your biggest challenge with Facebook lead generation right now?
