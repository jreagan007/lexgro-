# Divorce Lawyer SEO: How to Get Found First on Google

When someone decides to get divorced, they search Google. If you're not ranking, someone else gets that client.

Here's how to improve your SEO for divorce and family law.

## Why Divorce SEO Matters

Divorce searches are local and high-intent. Someone searching "divorce lawyer near me" needs help now.

PPC can capture these searches, but clicks cost $50-150 in competitive markets. SEO delivers the same traffic for free.

Over time, SEO produces dramatically better economics than paid advertising alone.

## The Divorce Keyword Landscape

### High-Intent Keywords

These searches indicate readiness to hire:

- "Divorce lawyer [city]"
- "Family law attorney near me"
- "Divorce attorney [city]"
- "Child custody lawyer [city]"

Target these in your service pages and local SEO efforts.

### Informational Keywords

These searches happen earlier in the journey:

- "How to file for divorce in [state]"
- "Divorce process explained"
- "Child custody laws [state]"
- "How long does divorce take"
- "Cost of divorce"

Target these with educational content. Capture prospects early and build trust before they're ready to hire.

### Long-Tail Keywords

Specific searches with lower volume but higher relevance:

- "High asset divorce attorney [city]"
- "Collaborative divorce lawyer [city]"
- "Father's rights attorney [city]"
- "Divorce mediation [city]"

These often convert better because they match specific needs.

## Local SEO Essentials

### Google Business Profile

Your GBP is critical for local searches. Complete optimization includes:

- Every category and attribute filled
- High-quality photos
- Regular posts
- Quick responses to questions
- Comprehensive service list

A well-optimized GBP can rank in the map pack even if your website isn't on page one.

### Local Citations

Ensure your firm appears consistently across directories:

- Legal directories (Avvo, Justia, FindLaw)
- General business directories (Yelp, BBB)
- Local directories specific to your area

NAP consistency (Name, Address, Phone) matters for local rankings.

### Reviews

Reviews impact both rankings and conversion. For divorce specifically:

- Potential clients want to see others who went through similar situations
- Reviews that mention specific outcomes build trust
- Recent reviews matter more than old ones

Systematically ask satisfied clients for reviews. Make it easy with direct links.

## On-Page SEO

### Service Pages

Create dedicated pages for:

- Divorce (general)
- Contested divorce
- Uncontested divorce
- Child custody
- Child support
- Alimony/spousal support
- Property division
- Mediation
- Collaborative divorce

Each page should target specific keywords and provide comprehensive information.

### Location Pages

If you serve multiple areas, create location-specific pages. But don't just swap city names. Include genuinely local content:

- Local court information
- Area-specific considerations
- Directions to your office

### Content Optimization

For each page:

- Target keyword in title tag
- Keyword in first 100 words
- Relevant headers with related keywords
- Comprehensive coverage of the topic
- Internal links to related pages
- Clear calls to action

## Content Strategy

### Educational Blog Posts

Answer questions your potential clients are asking:

- "What to expect in a divorce consultation"
- "How to prepare for divorce"
- "Understanding joint custody schedules"
- "Dividing retirement accounts in divorce"
- "How affairs affect divorce in [state]"

Create comprehensive guides, not thin posts.

### Fresh Content

Google rewards sites that update regularly. Publish new content monthly at minimum.

### Content That Converts

Include calls to action throughout your content. Someone reading about divorce process might be ready to schedule a consultation.

## Technical SEO

### Speed

Pages should load in under 3 seconds. Run Google PageSpeed Insights and fix issues.

### Mobile

Over half of divorce searches are mobile. Your site must work perfectly on phones.

### Security

HTTPS is essential. No excuse for unsecured sites.

### Site Structure

Logical URL structure and clear navigation help both users and search engines understand your site.

## Link Building

### Legal Directories

Maintain profiles on major legal directories. These provide authoritative backlinks.

### Local Opportunities

- Chamber of commerce
- Local bar association
- Community organizations
- Local media coverage

### Content-Based Links

Create content valuable enough that others want to link to it. Comprehensive guides and original research attract links naturally.

## Measuring Success

Track:

- Rankings for target keywords
- Organic traffic
- Leads from organic traffic
- Conversion rate
- Cost per lead (should be near zero for SEO)

SEO takes time. Expect 6-12 months for meaningful results. Track progress monthly to ensure you're moving in the right direction.

## Common Mistakes

### Thin Content

Pages with minimal content don't rank. Invest in comprehensive, helpful content.

### Ignoring Local

Divorce is intensely local. If you're not optimizing for local search, you're missing most opportunities.

### Impatience

SEO is a long game. Firms that give up after 3 months never see results. Firms that commit for 12+ months build sustainable traffic.

### No Reviews

Reviews affect rankings and conversions. A review strategy is part of an SEO strategy.

## The Bottom Line

Divorce SEO takes time and consistent effort. But the payoff is substantial: free traffic from people actively looking for help with divorce.

Invest in the fundamentals. Create comprehensive content. Optimize for local. Be patient.

The firms that win at divorce SEO build sustainable practices with predictable lead flow.
