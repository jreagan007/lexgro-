# Law Firm Budgeting 101: Where to Spend and Where to Save

Most law firms I work with are either spending too much on things that don't work or too little on things that would transform their practice.

The solution isn't spending more or less. It's spending smarter.

Here's how to think about your marketing budget.

## How Much Should You Spend?

The typical range for law firm marketing is 2-10 percent of gross revenue. Where you fall depends on:

- Your growth goals
- Your practice area competition
- Your market size
- Your current client acquisition efficiency

A firm that's happy with steady-state operations might spend 2-3 percent. A firm chasing aggressive growth in a competitive market might spend 8-10 percent.

For most growing firms, 5-7 percent is a reasonable target.

### The Math

If your firm generates $2 million in revenue and you want to grow, budget $100,000-$140,000 for marketing annually. That's $8,000-$12,000 per month.

If you're generating $500,000 and want to break through to the next level, plan for $25,000-$50,000 annually.

These are starting points, not rules. Your optimal budget depends on your specific situation.

## Where to Spend: The Priorities

### 1. Track Everything First

Before spending another dollar on advertising, make sure you can track results. This means:

- Call tracking to attribute phone leads
- Form tracking to capture online inquiries
- CRM integration to follow the client journey
- Clear reporting on cost per lead and cost per case

I've seen firms spending $20,000/month on advertising with no idea which campaigns actually produced cases. That's not marketing. That's gambling.

Tracking infrastructure costs maybe $200-500/month. It's the best money you'll spend.

### 2. Website That Converts

Your website is the hub of all marketing activity. Every ad, every Google search, every referral leads there.

A website that doesn't convert wastes every dollar you spend driving traffic.

Investment range: $5,000-$25,000 for initial build, then $500-2,000/month for maintenance and optimization.

Signs you need a new website:

- Not mobile-friendly
- Slow loading
- Doesn't clearly communicate what you do
- No clear calls to action
- Hasn't been updated in years

### 3. Google Business Profile

This is free and high-impact. Most local searches show the map pack first. If you're not optimized there, you're invisible for local intent searches.

Optimize your profile completely. Collect reviews. Post updates. Respond to reviews.

Cost: Free (or minimal if you hire someone to manage it).

### 4. Paid Search (When Ready)

PPC drives immediate results but requires significant budget in competitive legal categories.

Minimum viable budgets:

- Personal injury: $5,000-10,000/month
- Criminal defense: $3,000-7,000/month
- Family law: $2,000-5,000/month
- Immigration: $1,500-4,000/month
- Estate planning: $1,000-3,000/month

Below these thresholds, you won't generate enough data to optimize effectively.

### 5. SEO (Long-Term)

SEO takes time but delivers excellent economics once established. Budget for:

- Technical optimization
- Content creation
- Link building
- Ongoing monitoring

Expect to invest for 12-24 months before seeing significant results. But those results compound over time.

Investment range: $2,000-5,000/month for meaningful SEO programs.

### 6. Content Creation

Educational content supports both SEO and conversion. Budget for:

- Blog posts answering client questions
- Service page optimization
- Case studies and results
- Video content (if appropriate for your market)

This can be handled in-house or outsourced. Either way, plan for regular content production.

## Where to Save: Cut the Waste

### Generic Legal Directories

Many legal directories charge $500-1,500/month and deliver questionable value. Before renewing, demand data on actual leads generated.

Keep your profiles updated (that's free) but be skeptical of premium placements.

### Billboards (Usually)

Billboards work for some firms, but they're expensive and hard to track. For most firms under $5M in revenue, the money is better spent on trackable digital channels.

Exception: If you have a memorable hook and significant budget for frequency.

### Social Media Advertising (Sometimes)

Facebook ads can work for some practice areas but often disappoint for legal services. Test carefully with small budgets before committing.

### Print Advertising

Phone books are dead. Magazine ads rarely work for legal services. Newspaper ads occasionally make sense for local awareness but are hard to track.

### Vanity Metrics

Stop paying for impressions, reach, or clicks without conversion data. The only numbers that matter are leads and signed cases.

## The Budget Framework

Here's a typical allocation for a growing law firm:

| Category | Percentage of Budget |
|----------|---------------------|
| Paid Search (PPC) | 35-45 percent |
| SEO and Content | 20-30 percent |
| Website and Technology | 10-15 percent |
| Reputation (Reviews, etc.) | 5-10 percent |
| Testing New Channels | 10-15 percent |

Adjust based on what's working. If PPC is delivering cases profitably, spend more there. If SEO is starting to produce results, invest further.

## Tracking ROI

For every marketing dollar, know:

- How many leads did it generate?
- What was the cost per lead?
- How many became consultations?
- How many became clients?
- What was the revenue generated?

If a channel costs $3,000/month and generates 10 clients at $3,000 each, that's a 10x return. Double down.

If a channel costs $3,000/month and generates 1 client at $2,000, that's losing money. Cut it.

Simple math, but most firms don't track it.

## When to Increase Budget

Increase marketing investment when:

- Current channels are profitable and you've maximized them
- You're adding capacity (new attorneys, new practice areas)
- You're entering new markets
- Competitors are gaining market share
- You have clear data showing what works

Don't increase budget just because revenue is up. Increase when you have evidence of profitable channels you haven't fully exploited.

## When to Cut Budget

Reduce marketing investment when:

- You're at capacity and can't handle more clients
- Channels aren't producing trackable results
- Cash flow requires conservation
- You need to pause and rebuild strategy

Cutting budget isn't failure. Sometimes it's smart resource allocation.

## The Bottom Line

Smart marketing budgeting isn't about spending more. It's about spending on things that work and cutting things that don't.

Track everything. Invest in what produces results. Cut what doesn't. Test new channels with controlled experiments.

The firms that grow consistently aren't the ones with the biggest budgets. They're the ones who know exactly what their marketing dollars produce.
