## Introduction: Breaking the Feast-or-Famine Cycle

I've spent the last fifteen years watching law firm owners oscillate between two extremes: months where the phones ring constantly and you can barely keep up, followed by dry spells where you're checking voicemail compulsively and second-guessing your marketing spend. This isn't a natural business cycle. It's a symptom of treating lead generation like a tactical problem instead of a systems problem.

The feast-or-famine cycle happens because most law firms don't have a **system** for generating cases—they have a collection of tactics. You buy leads from a vendor here, run some Google Ads there, maybe someone referred a client yesterday. When you're lucky, referrals flood in. When you're not, suddenly you're desperate and making poor decisions about which cases to take.

I see this pattern constantly in conversations with firm owners. They say things like: "Lead generation is expensive," or "The quality is terrible," or "We can't afford to keep doing this." What they're really saying is: "I don't have predictable case flow, and I'm reacting instead of planning."

The difference between a struggling firm and a scaling firm isn't access to better lead sources. It's that scaling firms have built a **case generation system**—a predictable, repeatable process that converts interested prospects into retained clients. This guide is about building that system in your firm.

This isn't about getting more leads. It's about generating more cases from the prospects who contact you, regardless of where they come from. And when you do that, everything else becomes manageable.

## Lead Gen vs. Case Gen: Why "Lead Generation" Is the Wrong Goal

Most law firm marketing focuses on a single metric: the lead. Get the inquiry, count it as a win, move on. But here's what I've observed: the average law firm loses 40-60% of the cases they could actually close, and they don't even realize it's happening.

They lose these cases at three critical points:

**1. The Intake Conversation** - Your intake person answers the phone or reads the form submission. They ask a few questions, maybe they don't qualify the lead properly, or worse, they communicate that your firm isn't interested. By the time the attorney follows up (if they follow up), the prospect has already called three other firms.

**2. The Follow-Up Delay** - This is the killer. Someone fills out a form at 10 PM. Your firm doesn't respond until 4 PM the next day. In that time, they've already spoken to two other attorneys and decided to hire someone else. A prospect is ready to hire *right now*, not tomorrow. Not next week.

**3. The Qualification Gap** - Your intake person doesn't know which cases are actually valuable to your practice. They take notes, they sound polite, but they're not actually qualifying—they're just collecting information. The attorney looks at the file later and decides they don't want the case. But the prospect has already made a decision and moved on.

This is why I distinguish between "lead generation" and "case generation":

**Lead generation** is getting someone to contact you. It's a top-of-funnel metric. Useful, yes, but incomplete.

**Case generation** is turning that inquiry into a consultation, and the consultation into a retained case. This is what actually moves your business forward.

Here's the hard truth: you could double your lead volume tomorrow and still make the same amount of money if your conversion process is broken. Conversely, you could cut your lead volume in half, fix your intake system, and generate 30% more cases.

I've seen both scenarios play out. The firm with 150 inquiries per month but a solid intake system closes more cases than the firm with 300 inquiries and a chaotic one.

This is why the best firms I work with obsess over conversion metrics, not lead volume. They know that a 5% conversion rate (inquiry to case) on 100 inquiries is worth far more than a 1% conversion rate on 500 inquiries. Both generate 5 cases, but one has the scalability built in.

When you shift your focus from "how many leads can we generate?" to "how do we convert more inquiries into cases?", everything changes. Your intake process becomes a strategic priority. Your response time becomes sacred. Your qualification becomes sophisticated. And suddenly, the leads you're already getting are actually valuable.

## The Case Generation System: Building Predictable Flow with HowTo

Let me walk you through the system I've seen work best for law firms. I call it the HowTo framework, and it's broken into four components: How you get prospects to contact you, How you qualify them, To how you consult with them, and how To convert them into clients.

The framework starts before anyone contacts you.

**How: Building Authority and Awareness**

Before prospects reach out, you need to be visible as the answer to their problem. This isn't about vanity metrics. It's about ensuring that when someone in your area has a legal problem you can help with, they find you—not your competitor.

This happens through three channels:
- **Content**: The long-term play. Writing guides, articles, and answers that rank for the problems your ideal clients are searching for.
- **Direct marketing**: The medium-term play. Referral partnerships, strategic PR, and niche visibility in places your ideal clients congregate.
- **Paid acquisition**: The short-term play. Google Ads, local service ads (LSAs), and targeted advertising to reach ready-to-buy prospects.

Most firms pick one and ignore the others. The systems-thinking approach uses all three, but strategically allocates resources based on your practice and market.

For example, a personal injury firm might allocate 40% of marketing spend to paid (PPC/LSAs), 30% to building referral networks, and 30% to content. A family law firm might invert this: 50% content, 30% referrals, 20% paid. The proportion matters less than the intentionality.

**Qualification: The Pre-Intake Filter**

Before your human intake person talks to a prospect, your system should already be doing qualification work.

This happens through:
- **Intake forms**: Don't ask for their life story. Ask the questions that will determine if they're a fit. Do you handle this practice area? Are they in your geography? Do they have the ability to pay? Is their matter within your scope?
- **Automated responses**: When someone submits a form or calls, they should immediately know you received their inquiry and when they can expect a response.
- **Lead scoring**: Rank inquiries by conversion likelihood. A referral from a satisfied client is different from a cold web inquiry. Score them accordingly.

The goal isn't to reject prospects. It's to give your team the information they need to respond effectively.

**To (Consult): The Conversion Moment**

The consultation is where cases get made or lost. Most law firms treat consultations as administrative tasks—get the information, give the advice, hang up. They're actually your most important conversion tool.

A great consultation:
- Confirms the prospect is a fit for your firm
- Builds confidence in your expertise
- Establishes you as different from (and better than) the alternatives they're comparing
- Makes clear what the next step is

This requires your attorneys to be trained on consultation selling—not pushy, manipulative sales tactics, but genuine problem-solving conversations that help prospects understand their options and build trust in your firm.

**To (Close): The Retention Ask**

Here's where most firms fail: they hold a great consultation and then... wait for the prospect to come back to them. They don't ask for the engagement. They don't make it easy to say yes. They don't follow up.

Your system needs explicit asks:
- "Here's what I'd like to do next: get you a retainer agreement and move forward with your case. Can we do that today?"
- Clear pricing and payment options
- An easy way to sign and pay (electronic retainer, invoice, credit card)
- Immediate next steps that make the prospect feel like something is happening

This isn't pushy. It's clear. And it's the difference between a case you close and a prospect you lose to inertia or a competitor.

**From Keith:** I worked with a family law firm that was getting 80 inquiries per month but only closing 8-12 cases. Their system looked fine on the surface—they had an intake team, consultations were being scheduled, everything seemed organized. But when we traced a case from inquiry to engagement, we found delays at every stage. Form submission to intake call: 18 hours. Intake to attorney consultation: 3 days. Consultation to follow-up: sometimes a week. By then, prospects had already hired someone else. We compressed the timeline to: form to intake (30 minutes), intake to consultation (same day or next morning), consultation to close (same day when possible). Case volume doubled in 60 days. The number of inquiries stayed the same. But the system got faster.

## Intake Best Practices: Your Intake Is Costing You Cases

Your intake process is either your most valuable asset or your biggest leak. Most firms don't realize it's the latter.

Here's what a broken intake process looks like: A prospect calls. Your intake person is nice but distracted—they're checking email while you're on the phone. They ask questions in random order, write notes that barely make sense, and don't really qualify whether the case is a good fit. They say "we'll get back to you" without saying when. The file sits on someone's desk. By the time an attorney reviews it, the prospect has moved on.

A working intake process is precise and fast:

**Train your intake person like they're a closer, because they are.**

Your intake person is responsible for the most critical first impression. They answer the core question: "Is this firm right for me?" If the answer seems to be "maybe, we'll call you back," the prospect loses confidence. They're interviewing you as much as you're interviewing them.

This means:
- They know your practice areas and can explain what you do
- They can articulate your value proposition in conversation
- They understand which cases are good fits and which aren't
- They know the next step and can communicate it clearly

Most intake people are trained on logistics: get the name, number, case type. Train them on conversion instead.

**Create an intake script that qualifies, not interrogates.**

You should have a consistent set of questions, but they shouldn't sound like an interrogation. The flow should feel like a conversation.

For personal injury: "Tell me what happened... Were you injured?... Have you gotten medical treatment?... Are you working with any other attorney?" Questions should determine: (1) Do we handle this? (2) Do they have damages? (3) Are they exclusive to us? (4) Can they pay if there's no recovery?

For family law: "What's the main issue you need help with?... Do you have kids involved?... Do you have assets to divide?... Is your spouse represented?" Questions should determine: (1) Do we handle this? (2) What's the complexity? (3) Can they pay? (4) Are there complications (other attorney already involved)?

The script isn't rigid. It's a guide to ensure you're collecting the information you actually need.

**Respond within 5 minutes, not 5 hours.**

I'll cover this in more detail later, but it deserves emphasis here: response time to an inquiry is the single highest-leverage factor in case conversion. When someone fills out a form or calls, they're in a problem-solving mindset. They're ready to take action. That window closes fast.

Your intake process should allow for same-day response to all inquiries that come in during business hours. If you get inquiries at 10 PM, they should get a response by 9 AM at the latest.

This might mean:
- Your intake person works until 5 PM and handles same-day calls
- You have an automated form responder that acknowledges receipt within minutes
- You schedule consultations in real time during the intake call when possible
- You have backup coverage so no inquiry sits for hours

**Qualify ruthlessly, communicate clearly.**

Not every inquiry is a good fit. A solid intake process identifies misfits early and tells them quickly and kindly.

"I appreciate you contacting us. Based on what you've told me, your situation is more of a [specific issue] situation, and we actually don't handle that practice area. But here's who does handle this..." You've just turned down a bad case while being helpful. The prospect respects you more, and you save time.

Conversely, for good fits: "This is exactly what we do. Here's what the next step is..." You've confirmed the fit and provided clarity.

**Use a case management system that enforces the process.**

Your system should prevent cases from falling through the cracks. The moment an intake form is submitted, it should:
- Create a record with all information captured
- Assign it to an intake person
- Trigger a response (email, call, or both)
- Schedule a consultation
- Set a follow-up reminder if they don't respond
- Track time to response and time to consultation

Without this, cases get lost in email, voicemail, and human memory.

**From Keith:** I worked with a personal injury firm that had a capable intake person but a catastrophic process. She'd answer calls, write notes on a legal pad, and pass them to attorneys. Some notes were detailed, some were illegible. Some calls got noted, some didn't get recorded at all. We implemented a simple cloud-based system where every call and form triggered a structured intake record with required fields. Suddenly, intake became visible and measurable. We could see that one common case type (car accidents under $5K property damage) had a 15% conversion rate while another type (slip and fall with clear liability) had a 65% rate. This let us optimize marketing spend toward the higher-converting cases. The system revealed where the real conversion problems were—and they weren't in intake, they were in how attorneys were handling consultations.

## Why You're Losing Leads: A Diagnostic Checklist

Let's be specific about where cases get lost. Most firms I talk to believe they're losing cases because they don't have enough leads. The real reason is usually one or more of these:

**Response Time Lag**

You're not responding quickly enough to inquiries. A prospect fills out a form at 3 PM on a Friday. You respond Monday morning. By then, they've hired someone else.

Diagnostic: Look at your last 20 inquiries. How long between form submission and first contact? Average response time of more than 2 hours is a problem. More than 4 hours is a leak.

**Qualification Failure**

Your intake person is saying yes to every inquiry instead of qualifying aggressively. They're scheduling consultations for cases that are clearly bad fits, wasting attorney time and sending prospects to consultations with low conversion probability.

Diagnostic: Look at your last 10 scheduled consultations. How many of those converted to cases? If it's less than 30%, your intake is failing at qualification.

**Weak Consultation Process**

Attorneys aren't trained on consultation selling. They give information instead of building confidence. They don't ask for the engagement. They treat it like a free advice call instead of a sales conversation.

Diagnostic: Record (with permission) 5 consultations and listen to them. Did the attorney: (1) Confirm the fit? (2) Explain the process? (3) Address concerns? (4) Ask for the case? If you're missing any of these, that's your leak.

**No Clear Next Steps**

Prospect has a consultation and leaves thinking "I'll think about it and call back." No explicit ask. No urgency. No clarity about what happens next.

Diagnostic: Ask 10 of your recent clients what they thought would happen after their consultation before you asked them to retain. If they say "I wasn't sure" or "I thought you'd call me," your next-steps communication is broken.

**Pricing Confusion**

Your pricing is unclear, or the prospect thinks it's too high, but they never tell you directly. They just don't respond.

Diagnostic: After each consultation, ask the prospect directly: "Do you have questions about the fee?" If they say no but don't hire, they probably did have questions and were too uncomfortable to ask.

**Intake Team Turnover**

Your intake person left 2 months ago, and you've been handling calls yourself between meetings. You're slower, less consistent, missing follow-ups.

Diagnostic: How long has your current intake person been in the role? If it's less than 6 months, you're probably losing cases to inconsistency.

**Multi-Step Barriers to Engagement**

To hire you, a prospect has to: (1) Get approved for a retainer agreement, (2) Receive it by email, (3) Print and sign it, (4) Scan and return it, (5) Make a payment. You've just created five friction points.

Diagnostic: Count the number of steps between "I want to hire you" and "You're officially a client." More than 3 steps, and you're losing people.

**Lack of Follow-Up System**

Prospect doesn't respond after consultation. No one follows up. That's a lost case.

Diagnostic: Do you have an automated follow-up sequence for prospects who don't respond after consultation? If not, you're losing 15-20% of your potential cases.

**No Differentiation**

Your consultations don't distinguish you from the other three attorneys they're considering. You're talking about the same things, offering the same services, with the same energy level.

Diagnostic: What would a prospect say differentiates your firm? If the answer is "I'm not sure" or "you seemed nice," your differentiation isn't working.

---

## Response Time: The 5-Minute Rule

Let me be direct: response time is the highest-leverage factor in case conversion that you directly control. Everything else is important. This is critical.

Here's the data: A prospect calls or fills out a form. They're in a problem-solving mindset. They're comparing you to competitors. The first firm to respond has a massive advantage.

**Under 5 minutes**: You win the majority of the time. You're clearly ready to help. You're clearly different.

**5-30 minutes**: You're competitive but not dominant. The prospect might have already called another firm.

**30 minutes to 2 hours**: You've probably lost at least 30% of prospects to faster competitors.

**2+ hours**: You've lost the majority. The prospect has moved on.

This isn't theory. It's empirical. Response time has a direct, measurable correlation with conversion rate.

Let me share some real numbers: A criminal defense firm was responding to inquiries in an average of 4 hours. Conversion rate was 28%. We implemented a system where calls and forms were answered within 5 minutes during business hours (either by their intake person or by a recorded message + callback). Response time dropped to average of 12 minutes (for callbacks) or instant (for calls). Conversion rate went to 41%. Same firm, same marketing, same attorneys. The only variable was response time.

Here's how to make 5-minute response time happen:

**For phone calls**: Your intake person should be available during business hours. Not checking email, not in a meeting. Available. If they're not, the phone should go to a service or voicemail with a recorded callback commitment. "We'll call you back within 30 minutes." Then actually do it.

**For web forms**: You need either (1) an automated response with booking link, or (2) someone checking forms constantly. I recommend both. Automated response saying: "We received your information. If you'd like to speak with someone immediately, click here to schedule a call. Otherwise, we'll call you by end of business today." This takes 5 minutes to set up with most website platforms.

**For email inquiries**: Same approach. Automated response + someone actually responding within hours.

**For voicemail**: Return calls immediately. Not eventually. Immediately. Within the hour.

The cost of this is minimal. The return is massive.

**From Keith:** I watched a personal injury firm miss a case worth $80,000 in contingency fees because they didn't respond to a voicemail for 36 hours. When they finally called back, the prospect had already hired someone else. The cost of having someone answer phones faster? Maybe $200/month. The cost of losing that case? $80,000. The math is obvious. Yet most firms still let inquiries sit. They say "we're too busy to answer phones." What they mean is "we don't know how to hire properly" or "we're not prioritizing acquisition." Either way, it's a choice. A choice that's costing them a lot of money.

## Conversion Benchmarks: What's a Good Rate?

You can't improve what you don't measure. Here are the conversion benchmarks you should be tracking:

| Stage | Benchmark |
|-------|-----------|
| Website visitor to inquiry | 2-5% |
| Inquiry to consultation | 30-50% |
| Consultation to retained | 30-50% |
| Overall (visitor to case) | 0.5-1.5% |

Let's decode what these mean and how to use them:

**Website Visitor to Inquiry: 2-5%**

Out of 100 people who visit your website, 2-5 should contact you. This depends heavily on your practice area and traffic quality. A family law firm with targeted SEO traffic might hit 5%. A personal injury firm with mostly brand-aware traffic might hit 2%.

If you're below 2%, your website or messaging isn't clear about how to contact you, or your site traffic is mostly bottom-funnel visitors (already decided on another firm, just browsing).

If you're above 5%, great—you're doing something right. Don't change it.

**Inquiry to Consultation: 30-50%**

Of the inquiries you get, 30-50% should convert to an actual consultation. The other 50-70% are either disqualified (wrong practice area, wrong geography, etc.) or they don't respond to scheduling.

If you're below 30%, your intake qualification is too aggressive (disqualifying good cases), or your scheduling process is broken. If you're above 50%, you might not be qualifying aggressively enough—you're scheduling people who won't convert.

**Consultation to Retained: 30-50%**

Of the people you consult with, 30-50% should become clients. The other 50-70% decided to hire someone else, try to handle it themselves, or weren't as committed as they seemed during the inquiry.

If you're below 30%, your consultation selling process is weak, or you're getting bad fits to consultation. If you're above 50%, you're very selective about who you consult with—which is fine, just ensure you're not being too restrictive.

**Overall: 0.5-1.5%**

Combining all three stages, about 0.5-1.5% of website visitors should become clients. For a firm getting 1,000 web visitors per month, that's 5-15 new cases per month.

This varies widely by practice area. A high-ticket practice like construction defect might hit 0.3%. A high-volume practice like traffic tickets might hit 2%.

**How to use these benchmarks:**

Track each stage independently. If your overall conversion is 0.5% but you're doing great on inquiry → consultation (45%) and consultation → retained (40%), then your leak is at visitor → inquiry. Fix your website CTA and messaging.

If your visitor → inquiry is 3% but inquiry → consultation is only 20%, your leak is in intake. Fix qualification and scheduling.

If your visitor → inquiry is 3% and inquiry → consultation is 45% but consultation → retained is only 20%, your leak is in consultation selling. Train your attorneys.

## Lead Sources Compared: Quality, Cost, and Volume

Not all leads are created equal. Your job is to understand the tradeoffs and allocate resources accordingly.

| Source | Quality | Cost | Volume |
|--------|---------|------|--------|
| Referrals | High | Low | Limited |
| SEO | Medium-High | Medium | Scalable |
| PPC | Medium | High | Controllable |
| LSAs | Medium-High | Medium-High | Variable |
| Lead services | Low-Medium | Variable | High |

Here's what each means and how to think about it:

**Referrals: High Quality, Low Cost, Limited Volume**

This is the gold standard. Clients and other attorneys refer people who trust your firm already. Conversion rates are typically 50-70%.

Problem: You can't scale this on demand. You're limited by the number of satisfied clients and referral sources you have.

Strategy: Build a referral process. Ask clients for referrals explicitly. Build relationships with complementary attorneys who refer. Track which referral sources convert best and cultivate them.

You should be getting 20-40% of new cases from referrals. If you're getting less, you're not cultivating them. If you're getting more, you're lucky—don't become complacent.

**SEO: Medium-High Quality, Medium Cost, Scalable Volume**

People finding you through Google are actively searching for your service. Quality is good (not as good as referrals, but solid). Cost is moderate—you're paying a writer, consultant, or agency to build content and optimize.

Problem: It's slow. SEO typically takes 6-12 months to produce meaningful volume.

Strategy: Start immediately if you haven't already. Treat it as a long-term investment. Focus on keywords with commercial intent (people ready to hire), not just broad awareness keywords.

You should allocate 15-30% of marketing budget to SEO. It's not flashy, but it compounds over time.

For details on law firm SEO strategy, see our [complete guide to law firm SEO](/guide/law-firm-seo/).

**PPC: Medium Quality, High Cost, Controllable Volume**

Google Ads and other paid channels let you buy traffic immediately. You control the volume by controlling spend. Quality is medium—you're getting people actively searching, but you're competing for clicks with everyone.

Problem: It's expensive. You're paying $5-30+ per click depending on competition, and only 2-5% of those clicks become inquiries.

Strategy: Use PPC for high-ROI practice areas. If you make $5,000+ per case, a $2,000 customer acquisition cost is fine. If you make $1,000 per case, it's not.

Test carefully. Most firms overspend on PPC because they don't measure cost-per-case correctly.

You should allocate 10-30% of marketing budget to PPC depending on your case value and conversion rates.

For details on law firm PPC strategy, see our [complete guide to law firm PPC](/guide/law-firm-ppc/).

**Local Service Ads (LSAs): Medium-High Quality, Medium-High Cost, Variable Volume**

Google's LSA program shows you at the top of search results for people in your area searching for your service. You only pay when someone contacts you (not per click).

Quality is good—you're getting local, intent-driven prospects. Cost is medium-high—you're paying per lead, which can be $10-40+ per inquiry depending on competition.

Problem: Volume is unpredictable. Google controls how many leads you get, not you. You can't scale it as easily as PPC.

Strategy: Use LSAs as a supplement to other channels. It's particularly effective for practice areas with high local search volume (family law, criminal defense, personal injury).

Allocate 10-20% of marketing budget to LSAs if they're available in your area and practice.

**Lead Services: Low-Medium Quality, Variable Cost, High Volume**

Companies like LeadIQ, LEADS, and others sell "leads" to multiple attorneys. You pay per lead or monthly subscription.

Quality is low-medium. These are people who filled out a form saying "I need legal help," but they're being sold to 5-10 different attorneys simultaneously. Conversion rates are typically 5-15%.

Problem: You're competing with other attorneys for the same person. The lead quality suffers because the prospect isn't searching for you—they're responding to a general lead form.

Strategy: Only use lead services if you've exhausted other channels and have budget remaining. Measure cost-per-case carefully—it's easy to overpay for low-quality leads.

Allocate no more than 10% of marketing budget to lead services.

**The Math of Lead Sources**

Let's say you need 10 new cases per month. Here's how different source combinations could work:

**Option 1: Referral-heavy firm**
- 5 cases from referrals (50%)
- 3 cases from SEO (30%)
- 2 cases from PPC (20%)
Budget: $3,000/month (mostly SEO agency + some PPC spend)

**Option 2: High-volume firm**
- 3 cases from referrals (30%)
- 2 cases from SEO (20%)
- 3 cases from PPC (30%)
- 2 cases from LSA (20%)
Budget: $8,000/month

**Option 3: Service-dependent firm**
- 2 cases from referrals (20%)
- 3 cases from SEO (30%)
- 3 cases from PPC (30%)
- 2 cases from lead services (20%)
Budget: $6,000/month (varies based on lead costs)

The right mix depends on your market, practice area, case value, and growth goals. But the principle is the same: diversify. Don't depend on one source.

**From Keith:** I worked with a bankruptcy firm that was entirely dependent on Google Ads. When Google changed their ad policy and their ads got suspended for 3 weeks, case volume dropped to zero. Three weeks later, they were fired by a major client because they couldn't handle the case volume fluctuation. If they'd built SEO (slow, steady) and referral channels (reliable), they would have had cushion. Now they're rebuilding from scratch. Diversification isn't just smart—it's essential insurance against source volatility.

## Getting Started: Your Next Steps

You now understand the system. Here's what to do next:

**Week 1-2: Diagnose Your Current State**

Measure where you are right now. Pull data on:
- How many inquiries are you getting per month?
- How many of those convert to consultations?
- How many of those convert to cases?
- What's your average response time to inquiries?
- Where are your cases coming from?

You can't improve what you don't measure. Get a baseline.

**Week 2-4: Fix Your Response Time**

If you're not responding to inquiries within 5 minutes during business hours, start there. This is the highest-leverage change you can make. It's not complicated:
- Add a phone line with a live person or answering service
- Set up automated form responses
- Brief your team on response time expectations
- Track and measure it

**Week 4-8: Optimize Your Intake Process**

Once response time is fixed, improve what happens after first contact:
- Create an intake script that qualifies and sells
- Train your intake person on consultation selling
- Implement a case management system that tracks inquiries through conversion
- Set up automated follow-ups for prospects who don't respond

**Week 8-12: Train Your Attorneys on Consultation Selling**

This is harder than it sounds, because most attorneys didn't learn sales in law school. But consultations are sales conversations. Train your team to:
- Ask qualifying questions (confirm the fit)
- Explain the process (build confidence)
- Address objections (remove barriers)
- Ask for the case (close the sale)

**Month 4+: Optimize Your Lead Sources**

Now that your conversion process is solid, optimize where your leads come from:
- Double down on sources that are working
- Test new channels with small budgets
- Cut sources that aren't converting

Ready to build your system? Start with diagnosis. Everything else flows from understanding where you actually are.

**Q1: How much should I be spending on marketing?**

A: Most law firms spend 3-8% of revenue on marketing. If you're just starting and have no leads, spend more (8-15%). If you have a strong referral base and just need supplemental cases, spend less (3-5%). The key is measuring ROI per dollar spent. If a $1,000 marketing spend generates a $30,000 case, it's a 30x return. Do it. If a $1,000 spend generates a $500 case, stop.

**Q2: Should I use lead generation services?**

A: Only as a supplement, and only if you've measured cost-per-case. Lead services are convenient but low-quality. You're competing with other attorneys for the same lead. If you're desperate for volume and have exhausted other channels, they can work. But they shouldn't be your main strategy.

**Q3: How long does SEO take to work?**

A: 6-12 months to meaningful volume, 12-24 months to dominant positioning. If you're looking for fast case growth, start with PPC or LSA while you build SEO. But start SEO immediately if you haven't already. It compounds over time.

**Q4: What if I don't have the budget for a full marketing system?**

A: Start with one channel and do it well. If you have referral relationships, cultivate those ruthlessly. If you have existing clients, ask for referrals explicitly. If you need new leads, pick one channel (probably PPC or SEO depending on your timeline), master it, then add others. Most firms fail because they try to do everything with insufficient budget. Pick one thing and dominate it first.

**Q5: How do I know if my intake person is good?**

A: They should be able to tell you: (1) what practice areas you handle, (2) why your firm is better than competitors, (3) what the next step is for a prospect. If they can't articulate these, they need training. Also, measure their work: response time, conversion rate (inquiry to consultation), and satisfaction (do prospects feel heard and respected?).

**Q6: Should I hire a marketing agency or do it in-house?**

A: Depends on your size and expertise. Agencies are good for specialized channels (SEO, PPC) where expertise matters. In-house is good for integration and control. Most successful firms use a hybrid: in-house for strategy and intake, agencies for specific channels. But in-house needs to own the conversion metrics.

**Q7: Why do my conversion rates vary so much month to month?**

A: Because you don't have a system. You're relying on individual attorney performance, luck, and whatever you're focused on that week. A system is consistent. It measures everything, removes bottlenecks, and produces predictable results. If your conversion varies 20-30% month to month, you don't have a system yet.

**Q8: What's the best practice area to focus on for leads?**

A: The one with the highest conversion rate and case value in your firm. Don't pick based on market size. Pick based on what converts for you. A small market of people who definitely hire is better than a large market of people who might hire.

## Final Thought: Build the System, Not the Tactic

The firms that consistently generate cases aren't using secret tactics. They're using systems. They measure. They optimize. They remove friction. They train their teams. They ask for the business.

You have everything you need to build a case generation system today. The only question is whether you'll treat it as a priority.

Most firms won't. They'll keep doing what they've always done—hoping for referrals, chasing leads, reacting to market conditions. They'll stay stuck on the feast-or-famine cycle.

But you're reading this because you know there's a better way. There is.

Start with diagnosis. Measure where you are. Then fix the biggest leak. Then the next one. In 90 days, you'll have a system that generates cases predictably. In six months, you'll be shocked at the difference.

Your competitors are waiting for things to get better. You're going to build something better.

That's the system.
