# How to Educate vs. Sell in Estate Law Marketing

Estate planning marketing is tricky. You're asking people to think about their death. To confront difficult family dynamics. To spend money on something they'll never personally benefit from.

No wonder people procrastinate.

The solution isn't to sell harder. It's to educate better.

## The Estate Planning Marketing Challenge

Your potential clients know they need a will. They know they should have powers of attorney. They've heard about trusts.

But they don't feel urgent about it. There's no burning pain point like in personal injury. No crisis like in criminal defense. No deadline like in some business matters.

Estate planning gets pushed to "someday." Your job is to move it to "now."

## Education Beats Selling

Hard selling doesn't work for estate planning. "You need a will NOW!" sounds like fear-mongering. "Act before it's too late!" feels manipulative.

But education works. When you help people understand the real consequences of inaction, they motivate themselves.

### What Happens Without a Plan

Most people don't know what happens if they die without a will. Educate them.

- Who decides what happens to your assets?
- Who gets custody of your kids?
- How does probate work without a will?
- What are the costs and delays?

When people understand the default outcomes, they're more motivated to choose different ones.

### The Myths They Believe

People avoid estate planning partly because of misconceptions.

- "I don't have enough assets to need a plan"
- "My family will figure it out"
- "It's too expensive"
- "I'm too young"

Address these myths directly with educational content.

### Life Events as Triggers

Estate planning urgency often follows life events:

- Having a child
- Getting married
- Buying a home
- Starting a business
- Receiving an inheritance
- Divorcing
- Parent's death

Target your marketing to people experiencing these triggers.

## Content Strategy for Estate Planning

### Educational Blog Posts

Answer the questions people are actually searching:

- "Do I need a trust or just a will?"
- "How to choose a guardian for your children"
- "What is probate and how to avoid it"
- "Estate planning for blended families"
- "How often should you update your estate plan"
- "What happens to digital assets when you die"

Each piece of content is a chance to be found by someone ready to take action.

### Webinars and Workshops

Estate planning is perfect for educational events. People have questions they're uncomfortable asking one-on-one.

Topics that draw attendance:

- "Estate Planning 101: What Every Parent Needs to Know"
- "Protecting Your Family's Future: A Free Workshop"
- "Estate Planning for Business Owners"
- "Understanding Trusts: When Do You Really Need One?"

These events position you as the expert and give attendees a reason to hire you.

### Email Newsletters

Stay in touch with people who aren't ready to hire yet. Regular educational emails keep you top of mind for when they are ready.

Content that works:

- Tax law changes affecting estates
- Common estate planning mistakes
- Stories (anonymized) of what goes wrong
- Seasonal reminders (new year resolution to get a plan)

Don't sell in every email. Educate in most. Sell occasionally.

## Marketing Channels for Estate Planning

### SEO

Estate planning searches are often informational. "Do I need a trust" gets more volume than "estate planning lawyer near me."

Build content for the informational searches. That's where you capture attention early.

### Google Ads

PPC can work but tends to be expensive for limited search volume. Focus on high-intent terms:

- "Estate planning attorney [city]"
- "Trust lawyer near me"
- "Will preparation [city]"

### Facebook Advertising

Facebook's targeting lets you reach people by life events and demographics. Target:

- New parents
- Newlyweds
- Homeowners
- Business owners
- People over 50

Use educational content as the hook, not a hard sell.

### Referral Marketing

Estate planning referrals often come from:

- Financial advisors
- CPAs and tax preparers
- Real estate agents
- Insurance agents
- Other attorneys

Build relationships with these professionals. Offer to co-present educational seminars.

## Messaging That Resonates

### Lead with Benefits, Not Features

Not: "We prepare comprehensive estate plans."

Yes: "Protect your family and ensure your wishes are honored."

### Address Procrastination Directly

Acknowledge that this is something people put off. Then help them understand why acting now matters.

"We know estate planning isn't anyone's idea of a fun afternoon. But spending a few hours now can save your family months of stress and tens of thousands of dollars later."

### Emphasize Peace of Mind

The real benefit of estate planning isn't the documents. It's the peace of mind that comes from knowing your family is protected.

"Sleep better knowing your family is taken care of, no matter what."

## Tracking Success

Measure:

- Cost per lead by channel
- Content engagement (time on page, downloads)
- Workshop attendance and conversion
- Consultation requests
- New client origination source

Estate planning often has a longer sales cycle. Track leads through the entire journey, not just initial contact.

## The Bottom Line

Estate planning marketing works when you lead with education. Help people understand the stakes. Address their misconceptions. Make the process feel manageable.

The attorneys who succeed in estate planning aren't the best salespeople. They're the best teachers.

When you educate effectively, the sales follow.
